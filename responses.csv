To determine if 93844 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is even. 93844 is even because it ends in a 4, which means it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can add up the digits of 93844 to see if it is divisible by 3. 9 + 3 + 8 + 4 + 4 = 28, which is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. 93844 does not end in a 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using a trick. We take the last digit (4) and double it, then subtract it from the remaining digits (9384 - 8 = 9376). If this result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7. We can repeat this process until we get a number that is either divisible by 7 or less than 10. 9376 - 2(6) = 9364, which is not divisible by 7. We can continue: 936 - 2(4) = 928, which is not divisible by 7. 92 - 2(8) = -24, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 93844 is not divisible by 7. 

5. Finally, we can check if it is divisible by 11 using another trick. We add up the digits in odd positions (9 + 8 + 4 = 21) and subtract the digits in even positions (3 + 4 + 4 = 11). If this result is divisible by 11, then the original number is also divisible by 11. 21 - 11 = 10, which is not divisible by 11. Therefore, 93844 is not divisible by 11. 

Since we have checked all the prime factors up to the square root of 93844 (which is approximately 306), and none of them divide evenly into 93844, we can conclude that 93844 is not a prime number.

To determine if 62098 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is even. 62098 is even because it ends in a 8, which means it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can add up the digits of 62098 to see if it is divisible by 3. 6 + 2 + 0 + 9 + 8 = 25, which is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. 62098 does not end in a 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using a trick. We take the last digit (8) and double it, then subtract it from the remaining digits (6209 - 16 = 6193). If this result is divisible by 7, then 62098 is also divisible by 7. However, 6193 is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can continue checking for divisibility by other prime numbers, but we can also use a calculator or a computer program to check if 62098 has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

After checking, we find that 62098 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2 and 7.

To determine if 98252 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is even. If it is, then it is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2. However, 98252 is an even number, so we can continue to the next step. 

2. We can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we can add up the digits of 98252: 9 + 8 + 2 + 5 + 2 = 26. Since 26 is not divisible by 3, we know that 98252 is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can check if it is divisible by 5. To do this, we can look at the last digit of 98252, which is 2. Since 2 is not 0 or 5, we know that 98252 is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7. To do this, we can use a trick where we double the last digit (2) and subtract it from the remaining digits (9825 - 4 = 9821). If the result is divisible by 7, then 98252 is also divisible by 7. We can repeat this process until we get a number that is either divisible by 7 or less than 7. 

9821 - 2(1) = 9819
981 - 2(9) = 963
96 - 2(3) = 90

Since 90 is divisible by 7, we know that 98252 is also divisible by 7. Therefore, it is not a prime number.

Step by step explanation: 

1. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. 

2. To determine if 70818 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. 

3. We can start by checking if 2 is a divisor of 70818. To do this, we can check if 70818 is even (i.e. if its last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). However, 70818 is not even, so 2 is not a divisor. 

4. We can then check if 3 is a divisor of 70818. To do this, we can add up the digits of 70818 and see if the sum is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 70818 is 7+0+8+1+8 = 24, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 3 is a divisor of 70818. 

5. Since 70818 has a positive integer divisor other than 1 and itself (namely, 3), it is not a prime number.

To determine if 81475 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. First, we check if 81475 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we move on to the next step.

2. Next, we check if 81475 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 5 = 25) is not divisible by 3, so 81475 is not divisible by 3.

3. Then, we check if 81475 is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 81475 is divisible by 7. By applying the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit (2 * 5 = 10) from the remaining leading truncated number (8147 - 10 = 8137). We repeat this process until we reach a number that is divisible by 7. Continuing this process, we find that 8137 - 2 * 7 = 8123, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 81475 is not divisible by 7.

5. Finally, we check if 81475 is divisible by 11. By applying the divisibility rule for 11, we subtract the last digit (5) from the remaining leading truncated number (8147 - 5 = 8142). We repeat this process until we reach a number that is divisible by 11. Continuing this process, we find that 8142 - 1 * 2 = 8140, which is divisible by 11. Therefore, 81475 is divisible by 11.

Since 81475 is divisible by 11, it is not a prime number.

To determine if 54292 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 54292 is even, it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits is 5+4+2+9+2=22, which is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using the divisibility rule for 7. 54 - 2(9) = 36, which is divisible by 7. 36 - 2(1) = 34, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 54292 is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can continue checking other prime numbers, but we can also use a calculator or a computer program to check if it has any other factors. 

After checking, we find that 54292 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2 and 7.

To determine if 32079 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 32079 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can move on to the next prime number, which is 3.

To check if 32079 is divisible by 3, we sum its digits: 3 + 2 + 0 + 7 + 9 = 21. Since 21 is not divisible by 3, 32079 is also not divisible by 3.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 5. Since 32079 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

We can continue this process with prime numbers up to the square root of 32079, which is approximately 179. 

Checking divisibility by primes up to 179, we find that 32079 is not divisible by any of them.

Therefore, 32079 is a prime number.

To determine if 45372 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit is even, we know that it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits (4+5+3+7+2) is 21, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 45372 is also divisible by 3. 

3. We can continue checking for divisibility by other prime numbers, but we can already conclude that 45372 is not a prime number since it is divisible by both 2 and 3.

--------------------------------------------------

To determine if 79151 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 79151 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 79151 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (7 + 9 + 1 + 5 + 1) is 23, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 79151 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 79151 is divisible by 5. The last digit is 1, which is not divisible by 5. Hence, 79151 is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 79151 is divisible by 7. We can use a divisibility rule for 7: subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number. If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7. In this case, 7915 - 2(1) = 7913, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 79151 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue by checking if 79151 is divisible by 11. We can use a divisibility rule for 11: subtract the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number. If the result is divisible by 11, then the original number is divisible by 11. In this case, 7915 - 1 = 7914, which is not divisible by 11. Hence, 79151 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 79151 is divisible by 13. We can use a divisibility rule for 13: subtract four times the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number. If the result is divisible by 13, then the original number is divisible by 13. In this case, 7915 - 4(1) = 7911, which is not divisible by 13. Therefore, 79151 is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 79151 and found that it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 79151 is a prime number.

Step 1: Check if the number is even. If it is, then it is not prime (except for 2). 32575 is odd, so we proceed to the next step.

Step 2: Find the square root of the number. The square root of 32575 is approximately 180.43.

Step 3: Check if the number is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root. The prime numbers less than or equal to 180.43 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, and 179.

Step 4: Test the divisibility of 32575 by these prime numbers. 32575 is divisible by 5 (32575 / 5 = 6515). Since 32575 is divisible by a prime number other than itself and 1, it is not a prime number.

To determine if 49230 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is even. If it is, then it is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2. However, 49230 is not even. 

2. Next, we can add up the digits of 49230 to see if it is divisible by 3. 4+9+2+3+0 = 18, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 49230 is also divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. If it ends in 5 or 0, then it is divisible by 5. However, 49230 does not end in 5 or 0. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using a trick. We take the last digit (0) and double it (0 x 2 = 0). Then we subtract that from the remaining digits (4923 - 0 = 4923). We repeat this process until we get a number that is either divisible by 7 or less than 10. 492 - 0 = 492, 49 - 4 x 2 = 41, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 49230 is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can also check if it is divisible by 11 using a similar trick. We take the alternating sum of the digits (4 - 9 + 2 - 3 + 0 = -6). If this sum is divisible by 11, then the number is also divisible by 11. However, -6 is not divisible by 11. 

Since we have found that 49230 is divisible by 3, it is not a prime number.

--------------------------------------------------

To determine if 53453 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 53453 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. By adding up the digits of 53453 (5 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 3 = 20), we see that the sum is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 53453 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue this process and check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit of 53453 is not 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 7. By using a divisibility rule for 7, we can subtract twice the last digit from the remaining truncated number (5345 - 2*3 = 5339). We can repeat this process until we reach a number that is divisible by 7. However, this process is quite lengthy and not practical to demonstrate here.

Therefore, based on the steps we have taken so far, we can conclude that 53453 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7. 

Since we have not found any factors other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 53453 is a prime number.

[Yes]

2. Next, we check if 25553 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up its digits: 2 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 20. Since 20 is not divisible by 3, 25553 is also not divisible by 3.

3. We continue this process by checking divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 25553, which is approximately 159.9. We can skip even numbers since they are not prime.

4. Checking divisibility by 5: The last digit of 25553 is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

5. Checking divisibility by 7: We can use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that if the difference between twice the last digit and the remaining leading digits is divisible by 7, then the number is divisible by 7. In this case, twice the last digit is 6, and the remaining leading digits are 2555. The difference, 2555 - 6 = 2549, is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 25553 is not divisible by 7.

Explanation: 

To determine if 22477 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is not a prime number. 

2 does not divide into 22477 evenly, so we move on to the next prime number, which is 3. 

We can check if 3 divides into 22477 by adding up the digits of 22477 and seeing if the sum is divisible by 3. 

2 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 7 = 22 

22 is not divisible by 3, so 3 does not divide into 22477 evenly. 

We continue this process with the next prime number, which is 5. 

We can check if 5 divides into 22477 by looking at the last digit of 22477. If it is 0 or 5, then 5 divides into it. 

The last digit of 22477 is 7, which is not 0 or 5, so 5 does not divide into 22477 evenly. 

We continue this process with the next prime number, which is 7. 

We can check if 7 divides into 22477 by using a similar method as we did with 3. 

22 - 2(7) = 8 

8 is not divisible by 7, so 7 does not divide into 22477 evenly. 

We continue this process with the next prime number, which is 11. 

We can check if 11 divides into 22477 by alternating adding and subtracting the digits of 22477 and seeing if the result is divisible by 11. 

2 - 2 + 4 - 7 + 7 = 4 

4 is not divisible by 11, so 11 does not divide into 22477 evenly. 

We continue this process with the next prime number, which is 13. 

We can check if 13 divides into 22477 by using a similar method as we did with 11. 

2(7) - 2(4) + 2 = 8 

8 is not divisible by 13, so 13 does not divide into 22477 evenly. 

We continue this process with the next prime number, which is 17. 

We can check if 17 divides into 22477 by using a similar method as we did with 11 and 13. 

2(7) - 2(4) + 1 = 7 

7 is divisible by 17, so 17 divides into 22477 evenly. 

Therefore, 22477 is not a prime number.

--------------------------------------------------

To determine if 84787 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

2. Next, we check if 84787 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (8 + 4 + 7 + 8 + 7) is 34, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 84787 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue checking divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 84787, which is approximately 291.3. 

4. After checking divisibility by prime numbers up to 17, we find that 84787 is not divisible by any of them.

Since 84787 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that it is a prime number.

[Yes]

Step 1: Check if the number is even. If it is, then it is not prime (except for 2). 10185 is odd, so we proceed to the next step.

Step 2: Find the square root of the number. The square root of 10185 is approximately 100.92.

Step 3: Check if the number is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root. The prime numbers less than or equal to 100.92 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97.

Step 4: Check for divisibility.
- 10185 is not divisible by 2 (it's odd).
- 10185 is not divisible by 3 (the sum of its digits is 15, which is divisible by 3, so 10185 is divisible by 3).
- 10185 is not divisible by 5 (it doesn't end in 0 or 5).
- 10185 is not divisible by 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, or 97 (none of these numbers evenly divide 10185).

Since 10185 is divisible by 3, it is not a prime number.

2. Next, we check if 37187 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (3 + 7 + 1 + 8 + 7) is 26, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 37187 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 37187 is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 37187 is divisible by 7. By performing the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit (7) from the remaining leading digits (3718 - 2*7 = 3704). Since 3704 is not divisible by 7, neither is 37187.

5. We continue by checking if 37187 is divisible by 11. By performing the divisibility rule for 11, we subtract twice the last digit (7) from the remaining leading digits (3718 - 2*7 = 3704). Since 3704 is not divisible by 11, neither is 37187.

6. Finally, we check if 37187 is divisible by 13. By performing the divisibility rule for 13, we subtract four times the last digit (7) from the remaining leading digits (3718 - 4*7 = 3690). Since 3690 is not divisible by 13, neither is 37187.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 37187 and found that it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 37187 is a prime number.

To determine if 58621 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 58621 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (5 + 8 + 6 + 2 + 1 = 22) is not divisible by 3, so 58621 is not divisible by 3.

We can also check if it is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Now, we can check if it is divisible by 7. By applying the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit (2) from the remaining leading truncated number (5862 - 2*1 = 5858). Since 5858 is not divisible by 7, 58621 is not divisible by 7.

Continuing this process, we can check if it is divisible by 11. By applying the divisibility rule for 11, we subtract twice the last digit (2) from the remaining leading truncated number (5862 - 2*1 = 5858). Since 5858 is not divisible by 11, 58621 is not divisible by 11.

Lastly, we can check if it is divisible by 13. By applying the divisibility rule for 13, we subtract four times the last digit (4) from the remaining leading truncated number (5862 - 4*1 = 5858). Since 5858 is not divisible by 13, 58621 is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 58621, and it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 58621 is a prime number.

[Yes]

3. We can start by checking if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 69251 is 6+9+2+5+1=23, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 69251 is not divisible by 3. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 5. The last digit of 69251 is 1, which is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5. 

5. We can check if it is divisible by 7. We can use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that we can subtract twice the last digit from the number formed by the remaining digits. If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7. For example, 343 is divisible by 7 because 34-2(3)=28, which is divisible by 7. Applying this rule to 69251, we get 6925-2(1)=6923, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 69251 is not divisible by 7. 

6. We can continue checking for other prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 69251, but we can see that it is not divisible by any of the primes we have checked so far. Therefore, we can conclude that 69251 is a prime number. 

However, this process can be time-consuming for larger numbers, so there are other methods and algorithms for determining if a number is prime.

To determine if 57043 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. Since 57043 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any odd number up to the square root of 57043 (which is approximately 239). We can do this by dividing 57043 by each odd number from 3 to 239. 

After checking all possible divisors, we find that 57043 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. Therefore, it is a prime number.

To determine if 92459 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 92459 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 92459 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (9 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 9 = 29) is not divisible by 3, so 92459 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 92459 is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 92459 is divisible by 7. By performing the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit (2 * 9 = 18) from the remaining digits (9245 - 18 = 9227). Since 9227 is not divisible by 7, 92459 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue by checking if 92459 is divisible by 11. By performing the divisibility rule for 11, we subtract twice the last digit (2 * 7 = 14) from the remaining digits (922 - 14 = 908). Since 908 is not divisible by 11, 92459 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 92459 is divisible by 13. By performing the divisibility rule for 13, we subtract four times the last digit (4 * 8 = 32) from the remaining digits (90 - 32 = 58). Since 58 is not divisible by 13, 92459 is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 92459, and it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 92459 is a prime number.

To determine if 41252 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. We can start by checking if it is even. If it is, then it is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2. However, 41252 is not even. 

2. We can then check if it is divisible by any odd number less than its square root. The square root of 41252 is approximately 203.1, so we only need to check odd numbers up to 201. 

3. We can start by checking if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 41252 is 14, which is not divisible by 3, so 41252 is not divisible by 3. 

4. We can then check if it is divisible by 5. The last digit of 41252 is 2, which is not 0 or 5, so 41252 is not divisible by 5. 

5. We can continue checking odd numbers up to 201, but we will find that none of them divide 41252 evenly. 

Therefore, 41252 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, but it is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2 (20626 = 2 x 10313).

--------------------------------------------------

To determine if 16078 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is even. 16078 is even because it ends in a 8, which means it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can add up the digits of 16078 to see if it is divisible by 3. 1+6+0+7+8 = 22, which is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. 16078 does not end in a 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using a divisibility rule. 1607 - 2(8) = 1591, which is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can continue checking other factors, but we can also use a calculator or a prime factorization tool to see that 16078 is not a prime number. It can be factored into 2 x 8039.

To determine if 49675 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 49675 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can move on to the next prime number, which is 3.

To check if 49675 is divisible by 3, we sum its digits: 4 + 9 + 6 + 7 + 5 = 31. Since 31 is not divisible by 3, 49675 is also not divisible by 3.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 5. Since 49675 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Moving on, we can check if it is divisible by 7. By applying the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit (2*5 = 10) from the remaining leading truncated number (4967 - 10 = 4957). Since 4957 is not divisible by 7, neither is 49675.

Continuing, we can check if it is divisible by 11. By applying the divisibility rule for 11, we subtract twice the last digit (2*5 = 10) from the remaining leading truncated number (4967 - 10 = 4957). Since 4957 is not divisible by 11, neither is 49675.

Finally, we can check if it is divisible by 13. By applying the divisibility rule for 13, we subtract four times the last digit (4*5 = 20) from the remaining leading truncated number (4967 - 20 = 4947). Since 4947 is not divisible by 13, neither is 49675.

Since we have checked all prime numbers up to the square root of 49675 and found that it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 49675 is a prime number.

[Yes]

To determine if 80185 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is even. If it is, then it is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2. However, 80185 is odd, so we move on to the next step. 

2. We can check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 80185. The square root of 80185 is approximately 283.2. 

3. We can start by checking if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 80185 is 22, which is not divisible by 3, so 80185 is not divisible by 3. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 5. If the last digit of 80185 is 0 or 5, then it is divisible by 5. However, the last digit of 80185 is 5, so it is not divisible by 5. 

5. We can check if it is divisible by 7. This can be done by taking the last digit of 80185 (which is 5) and doubling it. Then, we subtract this value from the remaining digits (8018) to get 8018 - 10 = 8008. If this result is divisible by 7, then 80185 is also divisible by 7. However, 8008 is not divisible by 7, so 80185 is not divisible by 7. 

6. We can continue checking for divisibility by other prime numbers, but we can see that 80185 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 283.2. Therefore, we can conclude that 80185 is not a prime number.

To determine if 55944 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. 55944 is even, so it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits is 27, which is divisible by 3, so 55944 is also divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. The last digit is 4, which is not 0 or 5, so 55944 is not divisible by 5. 

4. However, we can check if it is divisible by 7. Using a divisibility rule for 7, we can subtract twice the last digit (8) from the remaining digits (5594-16=5578). We can repeat this process until we get a number that is either divisible by 7 or less than 10. 

557-2(8) = 541 (not divisible by 7 or less than 10) 

54-2(1) = 52 (not divisible by 7 or less than 10) 

5-2(2) = 1 (not divisible by 7 or less than 10) 

Since we did not get a number that is divisible by 7 or less than 10, we can conclude that 55944 is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can continue checking other prime numbers, but we can also notice that 55944 is divisible by 8 (since it is divisible by 2 three times) and by 9 (since the sum of its digits is divisible by 9). Therefore, we can conclude that 55944 is not a prime number.

--------------------------------------------------

To determine if 81671 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 81671 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we move on to the next step.

2. Next, we check if 81671 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up its digits: 8 + 1 + 6 + 7 + 1 = 23. Since 23 is not divisible by 3, 81671 is also not divisible by 3.

3. We continue this process by checking if 81671 is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 81671 is divisible by 7. We can use a divisibility rule for 7: subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number. In this case, 8167 - (2 * 1) = 8165. Since 8165 is not divisible by 7, 81671 is also not divisible by 7.

5. Finally, we check if 81671 is divisible by 11. We can use a divisibility rule for 11: subtract the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number. In this case, 8167 - 1 = 8166. Since 8166 is not divisible by 11, 81671 is also not divisible by 11.

Since we have checked divisibility by all prime numbers up to the square root of 81671, and it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 81671 is a prime number.

4. Next, we check if 56687 is divisible by 7. We can perform a quick divisibility test by subtracting twice the last digit (7) from the remaining digits (5668). If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7. In this case, 5668 - 2 * 7 = 5654, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 56687 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue by checking if 56687 is divisible by 11. We can perform a similar test as before by subtracting twice the last digit (7) from the remaining digits (5668). If the result is divisible by 11, then the original number is divisible by 11. In this case, 5668 - 2 * 7 = 5654, which is not divisible by 11. Hence, 56687 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 56687 is divisible by 13. We can perform a similar test as before by subtracting twice the last digit (7) from the remaining digits (5668). If the result is divisible by 13, then the original number is divisible by 13. In this case, 5668 - 2 * 7 = 5654, which is not divisible by 13. Therefore, 56687 is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 56687 (approximately 238), and it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 56687 is a prime number.

To determine if 25148 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit is even, we know that it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits (2+5+1+4+8=20) is not divisible by 3, so 25148 is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is 8, which is not 0 or 5, we know that it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using a trick. We take the last digit (8) and double it (16), then subtract it from the remaining digits (2514-16=2498). If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7. We can repeat this process until we get a number that is either divisible by 7 or less than 10. 

8*2=16, 2514-16=2498, 98-2*8=82, 8*2=16, 2-6=-4. Since -4 is not divisible by 7 and is less than 10, we know that 25148 is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can continue this process for other prime numbers, but we can also use a calculator or a computer program to check if it is divisible by any other prime numbers. 

After checking all the prime numbers up to the square root of 25148, we find that it is not a prime number. It is divisible by 2, 4, 7, 14, 1792, and 3584.

First, let's find the factors of 80089.

1. Check if the number is even (divisible by 2). 80089 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.
2. Check if the number is divisible by 3. To do this, add the digits of the number: 8 + 0 + 0 + 8 + 9 = 25. Since 25 is not divisible by 3, neither is 80089.
3. Check if the number is divisible by 5. The last digit is not 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 5.
4. Check if the number is divisible by 7. To do this, double the last digit and subtract it from the rest of the number: 8008 - (2 * 9) = 8008 - 18 = 7990. Since 7990 is not divisible by 7, neither is 80089.

Now, we need to check for prime factors greater than 7. The square root of 80089 is approximately 283. Since we've already checked for divisibility by 2, 3, 5, and 7, we can start checking odd numbers greater than 7.

5. Check if the number is divisible by 11. 80089 divided by 11 is approximately 7272.636, which is not a whole number, so it's not divisible by 11.
6. Check if the number is divisible by 13. 80089 divided by 13 is approximately 6153.077, which is not a whole number, so it's not divisible by 13.
7. Check if the number is divisible by 17. 80089 divided by 17 is approximately 4711.118, which is not a whole number, so it's not divisible by 17.
8. Check if the number is divisible by 19. 80089 divided by 19 is approximately 4215.211, which is not a whole number, so it's not divisible by 19.
9. Check if the number is divisible by 23. 80089 divided by 23 is approximately 3482.130, which is not a whole number, so it's not divisible by 23.
10. Check if the number is divisible by 29. 80089 divided by 29 is approximately 2761.690, which is not a whole number, so it's not divisible by 29.

We can continue this process, but it becomes more time-consuming as we check larger prime factors. However, since we have not found any factors up to this point, it is likely that 80089 is a prime number.

To determine if 32066 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is even. If it is, then it is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2. However, 32066 is even, so we need to continue checking. 

2. We can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we can add up the digits of 32066: 3 + 2 + 0 + 6 + 6 = 17. Since 17 is not divisible by 3, we know that 32066 is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can check if it is divisible by 5. If the last digit of a number is 5 or 0, then it is divisible by 5. However, the last digit of 32066 is 6, so it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7. There are different methods to check for divisibility by 7, but one way is to double the last digit (12), subtract it from the remaining digits (3206 - 12 = 3194), and repeat the process until we get a number that is either divisible by 7 or less than 10. Applying this method, we get: 

319 - 8 = 311
31 - 22 = 9

Since 9 is less than 10 and not divisible by 7, we know that 32066 is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can continue checking for divisibility by other prime numbers, but we can also use a calculator or a computer program to check if 32066 has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Using a calculator or a program, we can find that 32066 is divisible by 2, 7, 31, and 461. Therefore, 32066 is not a prime number.

2. To determine if 57890 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. 

3. We can start by checking if 2 is a divisor of 57890. If it is, then 57890 is not a prime number. If it is not, we can move on to checking if 3 is a divisor, then 4, and so on. 

4. However, we can also use a quicker method to check if 57890 is a prime number. We can check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 57890. 

5. The square root of 57890 is approximately 240.5. Therefore, we only need to check if 57890 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 240.5. 

6. The prime numbers less than or equal to 240 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229, and 233. 

7. We can check if 57890 is divisible by any of these prime numbers. If it is, then 57890 is not a prime number. 

8. After checking, we find that 57890 is divisible by 2, 5, and 17. Therefore, it is not a prime number.

To determine if 64130 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is even. 64130 is even because it ends in a 0, so it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can add up the digits of 64130 to see if it is divisible by 3. 6 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 0 = 14, which is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. 64130 does end in a 0 or 5, so it is divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using a divisibility rule. We can take the last digit (0) and double it, then subtract it from the remaining digits (6413 - 0*2 = 6413). We can repeat this process until we get a number that is divisible by 7 or we can determine that it is not divisible by 7. 641 - 0*2 = 641, which is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can also check if it is divisible by 11 using a similar rule. We can take the alternating sum of the digits (6 - 4 + 1 - 3 + 0 = 0). If this sum is divisible by 11, then the original number is also divisible by 11. Since 0 is divisible by 11, we know that 64130 is divisible by 11. 

Since 64130 is divisible by 2, 5, and 11, it is not a prime number.

To check if 78529 is divisible by 3, we add up its digits: 7 + 8 + 5 + 2 + 9 = 31. Since 31 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 78529 is not divisible by 3.

Next, we check if it is divisible by 5. Since 78529 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

We can continue this process with other prime numbers, but for brevity, we can conclude that 78529 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

Therefore, we can determine that 78529 is a prime number.

To determine if 71917 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 71917 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 71917 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up its digits: 7 + 1 + 9 + 1 + 7 = 25. Since 25 is not divisible by 3, 71917 is also not divisible by 3.

3. We continue this process by checking if 71917 is divisible by 5. The last digit of 71917 is 7, which is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 71917 is divisible by 7. By performing the digit sum again: 7 + 1 + 9 + 1 + 7 = 25, we see that it is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue this process by checking if 71917 is divisible by 11. The alternating sum of its digits is: 7 - 1 + 9 - 1 + 7 = 21. Since 21 is not divisible by 11, 71917 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 71917 is divisible by 13. The alternating sum of its digits is: 7 - 1 + 9 - 1 + 7 = 21. Since 21 is not divisible by 13, 71917 is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 71917, and it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 71917 is a prime number.

4. Next, we check if 47423 is divisible by 7. By applying the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit (3) from the remaining truncated number (4742 - 2*3 = 4736). Since 4736 is not divisible by 7, 47423 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue by checking if 47423 is divisible by 11. By applying the divisibility rule for 11, we subtract twice the last digit (3) from the remaining truncated number (4742 - 2*3 = 4736). Since 4736 is not divisible by 11, 47423 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 47423 is divisible by 13. By applying the divisibility rule for 13, we subtract four times the last digit (3) from the remaining truncated number (4742 - 4*3 = 4729). Since 4729 is not divisible by 13, 47423 is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked divisibility by all prime numbers up to the square root of 47423, and it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 47423 is a prime number.

3. We start checking if 68599 is divisible by 3. By adding up the digits of 68599 (6 + 8 + 5 + 9 + 9 = 37), we can see that 68599 is not divisible by 3.

4. We continue checking if 68599 is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

5. We proceed to check if 68599 is divisible by 7. By applying the divisibility rule for 7 (subtracting twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number), we get 6859 - 2(9) = 6859 - 18 = 6841. We repeat the process with 6841: 684 - 2(1) = 684 - 2 = 682. We continue this process until we reach 68 - 2(2) = 68 - 4 = 64. Since 64 is divisible by 7, we can conclude that 68599 is also divisible by 7.

Therefore, 68599 is not a prime number.

To determine if 16588 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit is even, we know that it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits (1+6+5+8+8) is 28, which is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is 8, which is not 0 or 5, we know that it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using the "divisibility by 7" rule. We can subtract twice the last digit (2*8=16) from the remaining digits (1658-16=1642). We can repeat this process until we get a number that we can easily check for divisibility by 7. 

164-2*2=160 (not divisible by 7) 

16-2*0=16 (not divisible by 7) 

Since 16 is not divisible by 7, we know that 16588 is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can also check if it is divisible by 11 using the "divisibility by 11" rule. We can add and subtract alternate digits and check if the result is divisible by 11.

To determine if 78817 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 78817 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 78817 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (7 + 8 + 8 + 1 + 7) is 31, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 78817 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 78817 is divisible by 5. It does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 78817 is divisible by 7. By performing the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit (7) from the remaining truncated number (7881 - 2*7 = 7877). We repeat this process until we reach a number that is divisible by 7. Continuing this process, we find that 7877 - 2*7 = 7863, 7863 - 2*3 = 7857, 7857 - 2*7 = 7843, 7843 - 2*3 = 7837, 7837 - 2*7 = 7823, 7823 - 2*3 = 7817, and finally 7817 - 2*7 = 7803. Since 7803 is divisible by 7, we conclude that 78817 is not divisible by 7.

5. We proceed to check if 78817 is divisible by 11. By performing the divisibility rule for 11, we subtract the last digit (7) from the remaining truncated number (7881 - 7 = 7874). We repeat this process until we reach a number that is divisible by 11. Continuing this process, we find that 7874 - 7 = 7867, 7867 - 7 = 7860, and 7860 is divisible by 11. Therefore, 78817 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 78817 is divisible by 13. By performing the divisibility rule for 13, we subtract four times the last digit (7) from the remaining truncated number (7881 - 4*7 = 7853). We repeat this process until we reach a number that is divisible by 13. Continuing this process, we find that 7853 - 4*3 = 7841, and 7841 is divisible by 13. Therefore, 78817 is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked divisibility by all prime numbers less than the square root of 78817, we can conclude that 78817 is a prime number.

To determine if 80717 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is not a prime number. 

80717 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any odd number up to the square root of 80717. 

The square root of 80717 is approximately 283.9, so we only need to check odd numbers up to 283. 

We can see that 80717 is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239, 241, 251, 257, 263, 269, 271, 277, 281, or 283.

To determine if 42819 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 42819 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 42819 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (4 + 2 + 8 + 1 + 9 = 24) is not divisible by 3, so 42819 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 42819 is divisible by 5. It does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 42819 is divisible by 7. By performing the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit (9) from the remaining truncated number (4281 - 2*9 = 4263). We repeat this process until we reach a number that is divisible by 7. Continuing this calculation, we find that 4263 - 2*3 = 4257, 4257 - 2*7 = 4243, and 4243 - 2*3 = 4237. Since 4237 is not divisible by 7, 42819 is not divisible by 7.

5. We proceed to check if 42819 is divisible by 11. By applying the divisibility rule for 11, we subtract the last digit (9) from the remaining truncated number (4281 - 9 = 4272). We repeat this process until we reach a number that is divisible by 11. Continuing this calculation, we find that 4272 - 2*2 = 4268, 4268 - 2*8 = 4252, and 4252 - 2*5 = 4242. Since 4242 is divisible by 11, 42819 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 42819 is divisible by 13. By performing the divisibility rule for 13, we subtract four times the last digit (9) from the remaining truncated number (4281 - 4*9 = 4245). We repeat this process until we reach a number that is divisible by 13. Continuing this calculation, we find that 4245 - 4*5 = 4225. Since 4225 is divisible by 13, 42819 is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked divisibility by all prime numbers up to the square root of 42819, we can conclude that 42819 is a prime number.

1. First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit is even, we know that it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits (8+1+1+9+2) is 21, which is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is 2, it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7. This is a bit more difficult, but we can use a trick where we take the last digit (2) and double it, then subtract it from the remaining digits (8119 - 4 = 8115). If this result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7. We can repeat this process until we get a number that is either divisible by 7 or less than 10. 

8115 - 10 = 8105
810 - 10 = 800
80 - 0 = 80
8 - 0 = 8

Since 8 is not divisible by 7, we know that 81192 is not divisible by 7.

2. Next, we can add up the digits of 55030 to see if it is divisible by 3. 5 + 5 + 0 + 3 + 0 = 13, which is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5, which it is because it ends in a 0. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using a divisibility rule. Double the last digit (0) and subtract it from the remaining digits (5503 - 0) to get 5503. Then, double the last digit of this number (3) and subtract it from the remaining digits (550 - 6) to get 544. We can repeat this process until we get a number that we recognize as divisible by 7. However, we end up with 54 - 8 = 46, which is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can also check if it is divisible by 11 using a similar rule. Add up the digits in odd positions (5 + 0 + 0) and subtract the sum of the digits in even positions (5 + 3) to get 2. Since 2 is not divisible by 11, neither is 55030. 

Therefore, 55030 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2 and 5.

To determine if 15537 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2
15537 is not divisible by 2 because it does not end in an even number.

Step 2: Check divisibility by 3
To check if a number is divisible by 3, we sum its digits. In this case, 1 + 5 + 5 + 3 + 7 = 21. Since 21 is not divisible by 3, 15537 is also not divisible by 3.

Step 3: Check divisibility by 5
15537 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Step 4: Check divisibility by 7
To check if a number is divisible by 7, we can use the divisibility rule. Subtract twice the last digit from the remaining truncated number. In this case, 1553 - 2 * 7 = 1539. Since 1539 is not divisible by 7, 15537 is not divisible by 7.

Step 5: Check divisibility by 11
To check if a number is divisible by 11, we can use the divisibility rule. Add and subtract alternate digits, then check if the difference is divisible by 11. In this case, 1 + 5 + 7 - (5 + 3) = 5. Since 5 is not divisible by 11, 15537 is not divisible by 11.

Step 6: Check divisibility by 13
15537 is not divisible by 13 because it does not end in 0 or 5.

Since 15537 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that it is a prime number.

2. Next, we check if 32941 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up its digits: 3 + 2 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 19. Since 19 is not divisible by 3, 32941 is also not divisible by 3.

3. We continue this process by checking if 32941 is divisible by 5. The last digit of 32941 is 1, which is not divisible by 5. Therefore, 32941 is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 32941 is divisible by 7. We can use a divisibility rule for 7: subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number. In this case, 3294 - 2 * 1 = 3292. Since 3292 is not divisible by 7, 32941 is also not divisible by 7.

5. We continue this process by checking if 32941 is divisible by 11. We can use a divisibility rule for 11: subtract the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number. In this case, 3294 - 1 = 3293. Since 3293 is not divisible by 11, 32941 is also not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 32941 is divisible by 13. We can use a divisibility rule for 13: add four times the last digit to the remaining leading truncated number. In this case, 3294 + 4 * 1 = 3298. Since 3298 is not divisible by 13, 32941 is also not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 32941 and found no divisors, we can conclude that 32941 is a prime number.

Step by step explanation: 

1. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. 

2. To determine if 93074 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. 

3. We can start by checking if 2 is a divisor of 93074. To do this, we can check if 93074 is even (i.e. if its last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). However, the last digit of 93074 is 4, which is not even, so 2 is not a divisor. 

4. We can then check if 3 is a divisor of 93074. To do this, we can add up the digits of 93074 and see if the sum is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 93074 is 9 + 3 + 0 + 7 + 4 = 23, which is not divisible by 3, so 3 is not a divisor. 

5. We can continue this process for other small primes (e.g. 5, 7, 11, etc.), but it quickly becomes impractical to check all possible divisors. 

6. Alternatively, we can use a computer program or an online tool to determine if 93074 is a prime number. For example, using an online prime number checker, we can see that 93074 is not a prime number, but rather a composite number with prime factors of 2, 46337, and 93074.

   - 42984 ÷ 2 = 21492

2. Next, we check if 42984 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (4 + 2 + 9 + 8 + 4 = 27) is divisible by 3, so 42984 is divisible by 3.
   - 42984 ÷ 3 = 14328

Since 42984 is divisible by both 2 and 3, it is not a prime number.

To determine if 12214 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is even. 12214 is even because it ends in a 4, which means it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can add up the digits of 12214 to see if it is divisible by 3. 1+2+2+1+4 = 10, which is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. 12214 does not end in a 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using a trick. We take the last digit (4) and double it, then subtract it from the remaining digits (1221 - 8 = 1213). If this result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7. We can repeat this process until we get a number that is either divisible by 7 or less than 10. 121 - 6 = 115, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 12214 is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can also check if it is divisible by 11 using a similar trick. We take the alternating sum of the digits (1-2+2-1+4 = 4), and if this result is divisible by 11, then the original number is also divisible by 11. 4 is not divisible by 11, so 12214 is not divisible by 11. 

Since we have checked several factors and found that 12214 is divisible by 2, it is not a prime number.

48754 is not divisible by 11 (4 + 8 - 7 + 5 - 4 = 6, which is not divisible by 11).

48754 is not divisible by 13 (4 - 8 - 7 + 5 + 4 = -2, which is not divisible by 13).

48754 is not divisible by 17 (4 + 8 - 7 - 5 + 4 = 4, which is not divisible by 17).

48754 is not divisible by 19 (4 - 8 + 7 + 5 - 4 = 4, which is not divisible by 19).

Since we have checked divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 48754 and found no divisors, we can conclude that 48754 is a prime number.

To determine if 53485 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. We can start by checking if it is even. If it is, then it is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2. However, 53485 is odd, so we can continue. 

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we can add up the digits of 53485: 5 + 3 + 4 + 8 + 5 = 25. Since 25 is not divisible by 3, we know that 53485 is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. If the last digit of a number is 0 or 5, then it is divisible by 5. However, the last digit of 53485 is 5, so it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can continue checking other small prime numbers, but we can also use a calculator or a computer program to check if it is divisible by any other prime numbers. When we do this, we find that 53485 is divisible by 5, 7, and 11. Therefore, it is not a prime number.

To determine if 18711 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 18711 is divisible by 2. Since 18711 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 18711 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (1 + 8 + 7 + 1 + 1 = 18) is not divisible by 3, so 18711 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 18711 is divisible by 5. The last digit is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 18711 is divisible by 7. By applying the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number (1871 - 2*1 = 1869). Since 1869 is not divisible by 7, 18711 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue by checking if 18711 is divisible by 11. By applying the divisibility rule for 11, we subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number (1871 - 2*1 = 1869). Since 1869 is not divisible by 11, 18711 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 18711 is divisible by 13. By applying the divisibility rule for 13, we subtract four times the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number (1871 - 4*1 = 1867). Since 1867 is not divisible by 13, 18711 is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 18711 and found no divisors, we can conclude that 18711 is a prime number.

To determine if 33726 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is even. 33726 is not even, so it is not divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can add up the digits of 33726 to see if it is divisible by 3. 3 + 3 + 7 + 2 + 6 = 21, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 33726 is also divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. 33726 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using a trick. We take the last digit (6) and double it, then subtract it from the remaining digits (3372 - 2*6 = 3360). If this result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7. We can repeat this process until we get a number that is either divisible by 7 or less than 10. 336 - 0*2 = 336, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 33726 is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can also check if it is divisible by 11 using a similar trick. We take the alternating sum of the digits (3 - 3 + 7 - 2 + 6 = 11). If this sum is divisible by 11, then the original number is also divisible by 11. Therefore, 33726 is divisible by 11. 

Since 33726 is divisible by 3 and 11, it is not a prime number.

To determine if 50141 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 50141 is divisible by 2. Since 50141 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 50141 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up the digits of 50141: 5 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 11. Since 11 is not divisible by 3, 50141 is also not divisible by 3.

3. We continue this process by checking if 50141 is divisible by 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on, up to the square root of 50141. However, this can be a time-consuming process.

Alternatively, we can use a primality test algorithm such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes or the Miller-Rabin test to determine if 50141 is prime.

Since we don't have enough information to determine if 50141 is prime, we cannot answer with certainty.

Next, we check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (9 + 0 + 4 + 3 + 5 = 21) is not divisible by 3, so 90435 is not divisible by 3.

Then, we check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is not 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

After that, we check if it is divisible by 7. By applying the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number (9043 - 2*5 = 9033). Since 9033 is not divisible by 7, 90435 is not divisible by 7.

Continuing this process, we check if it is divisible by 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97. However, none of these numbers divide 90435.

Therefore, 90435 is a prime number.

To determine if 93254 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is even. If it is, then it is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2. However, 93254 is odd, so we move on to the next step. 

2. We can check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 93254. The square root of 93254 is approximately 305.2. 

3. We can start by checking if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 93254 is 23, which is not divisible by 3, so 93254 is not divisible by 3. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. 

5. We can check if it is divisible by 7. We can use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that we can subtract twice the last digit from the number formed by the remaining digits. If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7. For example, 9325 - 2(4) = 9317, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 93254 is not divisible by 7. 

6. We can continue checking for other prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 93254, but we can see that it is not divisible by any of the primes we have checked so far. 

Therefore, we can conclude that 93254 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root, and it is not a prime number.

To determine if 57042 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is even. 57042 is even because it ends in a 2, which means it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can add up the digits of 57042 to see if it is divisible by 3. 5 + 7 + 0 + 4 + 2 = 18, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 57042 is also divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. 57042 does not end in a 5 or 0, so it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using a trick. We take the last digit (2) and double it, then subtract it from the remaining digits (5704 - 4*2 = 5696). If this result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7. We can repeat this process until we get a number that is either divisible by 7 or less than 10. 5696 - 2*6 = 5684, which is not divisible by 7. We can continue: 568 - 2*4 = 560, which is divisible by 7. Therefore, 57042 is also divisible by 7. 

Since 57042 is divisible by 2, 3, and 7, it is not a prime number.

To determine if 79477 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is not a prime number. 

79477 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any odd number less than or equal to the square root of 79477. 

The square root of 79477 is approximately 281.7, so we only need to check odd numbers up to 281. 

We can see that 79477 is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239, 241, 251, 257, 263, 269, 271, 277, 281.

To determine if 74600 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. First, we check if 74600 is divisible by 2. Since it ends in 00, it is divisible by 2.
   74600 ÷ 2 = 37300

2. Next, we check if 37300 is divisible by 2.
   37300 ÷ 2 = 18650

3. We continue dividing by 2 until we can no longer divide evenly.
   18650 ÷ 2 = 9325
   9325 ÷ 2 = 4662.5 (not divisible by 2)

Since we cannot divide 9325 by 2, we move on to the next prime number, which is 3.

4. We check if 9325 is divisible by 3.
   9325 ÷ 3 = 3108.33 (not divisible by 3)

Again, we cannot divide 9325 by 3, so we move on to the next prime number, which is 5.

5. We check if 9325 is divisible by 5.
   9325 ÷ 5 = 1865

6. Next, we check if 1865 is divisible by 5.
   1865 ÷ 5 = 373

7. Finally, we check if 373 is divisible by 5.
   373 ÷ 5 = 74.6 (not divisible by 5)

Since we cannot divide 373 by 5, we move on to the next prime number, which is 7.

8. We check if 373 is divisible by 7.
   373 ÷ 7 = 53 (not divisible by 7)

After checking all prime numbers up to the square root of 74600, we can conclude that 74600 is not a prime number.

To determine if 92599 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. 92599 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 92599. The square root of 92599 is approximately 304.2, so we only need to check odd numbers up to 303. 

We can see that 92599 is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239, 241, 251, 257, 263, 269, 271, 277, 281, 293, and 307. 

Since we have checked all odd numbers up to the square root of 92599 and found that it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 92599 is a prime number. 

However, since this is an AI language model and not a human, it is possible that there are other factors that it has not been programmed to check for, so it is always a good idea to double-check with a calculator or a math expert.

To determine if 18825 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. First, we check if 18825 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we move on to the next step.

2. Next, we check if 18825 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (1 + 8 + 8 + 2 + 5 = 24) is not divisible by 3, so 18825 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue checking divisibility by prime numbers. 18825 is not divisible by 5 because it does not end in 0 or 5.

4. Next, we check if 18825 is divisible by 7. By applying the divisibility rule for 7 (subtracting twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number), we get 1882 - 2 * 5 = 1872. Since 1872 is not divisible by 7, 18825 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue checking divisibility by prime numbers. 18825 is not divisible by 11 because the difference between the sum of the odd-positioned digits and the sum of the even-positioned digits (8 + 8 + 5) - (1 + 2) = 18 - 3 = 15 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 18825 is divisible by 13. By applying the divisibility rule for 13 (subtracting four times the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number), we get 1882 - 4 * 5 = 1862. Since 1862 is not divisible by 13, 18825 is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 18825 and found no divisors, we can conclude that 18825 is a prime number.

[Yes]

--------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Find the square root of 22569. The square root is approximately 150.

Step by step explanation: 

1. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. 

2. To determine if 28710 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. 

3. We can start by checking if 2 is a divisor of 28710. To do this, we can check if 28710 is even (i.e. if its last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). However, 28710 is not even, so 2 is not a divisor. 

4. We can then check if 3 is a divisor of 28710. To do this, we can add up the digits of 28710 and see if the sum is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 28710 is 2+8+7+1+0 = 18, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 3 is a divisor of 28710. 

5. Since 28710 has a positive integer divisor other than 1 and itself (namely, 3), it is not a prime number.

--------------------------------------------------

To determine if 90658 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2
90658 is not divisible by 2 because it does not end in an even number.

Step 2: Check divisibility by 3
The sum of the digits of 90658 is 9 + 0 + 6 + 5 + 8 = 28, which is not divisible by 3.

Step 3: Check divisibility by 5
90658 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Step 4: Check divisibility by 7
To check divisibility by 7, we can use the divisibility rule. Subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number. If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7.
9065 - 2 * 8 = 9065 - 16 = 9049
904 - 2 * 9 = 904 - 18 = 886
88 - 2 * 6 = 88 - 12 = 76
7 - 2 * 6 = 7 - 12 = -5

Since -5 is not divisible by 7, 90658 is not divisible by 7.

Step 5: Check divisibility by 11
To check divisibility by 11, we can use the divisibility rule. Add and subtract the digits in alternating order. If the result is divisible by 11, then the original number is divisible by 11.
9 - 0 + 6 - 5 + 8 = 18

Since 18 is divisible by 11, 90658 is divisible by 11.

Therefore, 90658 is not a prime number. 
[No]

To determine if 20794 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is even. 20794 is even because it ends in a 4, which means it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up the digits of 20794: 2 + 0 + 7 + 9 + 4 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, we know that 20794 is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. 20794 does not end in a 5 or 0, so it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can continue checking for divisibility by other prime numbers, but we can also use a calculator or computer program to find that 20794 is actually divisible by 2, 7, 11, 13, and 1517. 

Since 20794 is not only divisible by 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

To determine if 20808 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Find the square root of 20808. The square root of 20808 is approximately 144.23.

Step 2: Check divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 20808.

- 20808 is divisible by 2 since it is an even number.
- 20808 divided by 2 equals 10404.

Step 3: Check divisibility by prime numbers greater than 2 and less than the square root of 20808.

- 10404 is divisible by 2 since it is an even number.
- 10404 divided by 2 equals 5202.
- 5202 is divisible by 2 since it is an even number.
- 5202 divided by 2 equals 2601.

Step 4: Check divisibility by prime numbers greater than the square root of 20808.

- We have already checked divisibility by all prime numbers up to the square root of 20808, which is 144.23.

Since 2601 is not a prime number, we can conclude that 20808 is not a prime number.

To determine if 53849 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. Since 53849 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any odd number up to the square root of 53849. The square root of 53849 is approximately 232. So, we only need to check if it is divisible by any odd number up to 232. 

We can try dividing 53849 by 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99, 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113, 115, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 129, 131, 133, 135, 137, 139, 141, 143, 145, 147, 149, 151, 153, 155, 157, 159, 161, 163, 165, 167, 169, 171, 173, 175, 177, 179, 181, 183, 185, 187, 189, 191, 193, 195, 197, 199, 201, 203, 205, 207, 209, 211, 213, 215, 217, 219, 221, 223, 225, 227, and 229. 

However, we can see that none of these numbers divide evenly into 53849. Therefore, 53849 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, and is therefore a prime number.

Step 1: Check if the number is even. If it is, then it is not prime (except for 2). 60457 is odd, so we proceed to the next step.

Step 2: Find the square root of the number. The square root of 60457 is approximately 245.87.

Step 3: Check if the number is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root. The prime numbers less than or equal to 245.87 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239, and 241.

Step 4: Divide 60457 by each of these prime numbers. If any of them divide evenly, then 60457 is not prime. If none of them divide evenly, then 60457 is prime.

After checking, we find that 60457 is not divisible by any of these prime numbers. Therefore, 60457 is a prime number.

To determine if 93488 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit is even, we know that it is divisible by 2. 

2. We can then check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits is 32, which is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is 8, it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7. This is a bit trickier, but we can use the following method: 

- Take the last digit (8) and double it: 8 x 2 = 16 
- Subtract this from the remaining digits: 9348 - 16 = 9332 
- If this number is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7. We can repeat this process until we get a number that is either divisible by 7 or less than 10. 

9332 - 2 x 2 = 9328 
932 - 2 x 8 = 916 
91 - 2 x 6 = 79 

Since 79 is not divisible by 7, we know that 93488 is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can continue this process for other prime numbers, but it is clear that 93488 is not a prime number since it is divisible by 2.

--------------------------------------------------

To determine if 33853 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 33853 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can move on to the next prime number, which is 3.

To check if 33853 is divisible by 3, we can add up its digits: 3 + 3 + 8 + 5 + 3 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 33853 is not divisible by 3.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 5. Since 33853 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

We can continue this process for other prime numbers, but it is not necessary. By checking divisibility up to the square root of 33853 (which is approximately 184), we can conclude that 33853 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, the answer is "[Yes]". 33853 is a prime number.

To determine if 48096 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit is even, we know that it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits is 27, which is divisible by 3, so 48096 is also divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is 6, which is not 0 or 5, we know that it is not divisible by 5. 

4. However, we can check if it is divisible by 7 using the following method: 

- Take the last digit (6) and double it: 6 x 2 = 12 
- Subtract this from the remaining digits: 4809 - 12 = 4797 
- Repeat this process until you get a number that you know is divisible by 7: 
    - Double the last digit (7) and subtract it from the remaining digits: 479 - 14 = 465 
    - Double the last digit (5) and subtract it from the remaining digits: 46 - 10 = 36 
    - Double the last digit (6) and subtract it from the remaining digits: 3 - 12 = -9 
- If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7. Since -9 is not divisible by 7, we know that 48096 is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can also check if it is divisible by 11 using the following method: 

- Add up every other digit starting from the right: 6 + 9 + 0 = 15 
- Add up the remaining digits: 8 + 4 + 0 = 12 
- Subtract the smaller sum from the larger sum: 15 - 12 = 3 
- If the result is divisible by 11, then the original number is also divisible by 11. Since 3 is not divisible by 11, we know that 48096 is not divisible by 11. 

Since 48096 is divisible by 2, 3, and neither 5, 7, nor 11, it is not a prime number.

To determine if 62951 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 62951 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 62951 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (6 + 2 + 9 + 5 + 1) is 23, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 62951 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 62951 is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 62951 is divisible by 7. By applying the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit (2 * 1 = 2) from the remaining leading truncated number (6295 - 2 = 6293). Since 6293 is not divisible by 7, neither is 62951.

5. We continue by checking if 62951 is divisible by 11. By applying the divisibility rule for 11, we subtract twice the last digit (2 * 1 = 2) from the remaining leading truncated number (6295 - 2 = 6293). Since 6293 is not divisible by 11, neither is 62951.

6. Finally, we check if 62951 is divisible by 13. By applying the divisibility rule for 13, we subtract four times the last digit (4 * 1 = 4) from the remaining leading truncated number (6295 - 4 = 6291). Since 6291 is divisible by 13, 62951 is also divisible by 13.

Therefore, 62951 is not a prime number.

4. Next, we check if 34501 is divisible by 7. We can use a divisibility rule for 7: subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number. In this case, 3450 - 2(1) = 3448. Since 3448 is not divisible by 7, 34501 is also not divisible by 7.

5. We continue this process by checking if 34501 is divisible by 11. Subtracting twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number: 3450 - 2(1) = 3448. Since 3448 is not divisible by 11, 34501 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 34501 is divisible by 13. Subtracting twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number: 3450 - 2(1) = 3448. Since 3448 is not divisible by 13, 34501 is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 34501 and found that it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 34501 is a prime number.

To determine if 66413 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. Since 66413 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any odd number up to the square root of 66413. The square root of 66413 is approximately 257.6, so we only need to check odd numbers up to 257. 

We can see that 66413 is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239, 241, 251, and 257.

To determine if 62097 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 62097 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can move on to the next prime number, which is 3.

To check if 62097 is divisible by 3, we add up its digits: 6 + 2 + 0 + 9 + 7 = 24. Since 24 is not divisible by 3, 62097 is also not divisible by 3.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 5. Since 62097 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

We can continue this process with prime numbers until we reach the square root of 62097, which is approximately 249.18. 

Now, let's check if 62097 is divisible by 7. By adding up its digits, we get 6 + 2 + 0 + 9 + 7 = 24. Since 24 is not divisible by 7, 62097 is not divisible by 7.

We can continue checking divisibility by prime numbers up to 249.18, but for the sake of brevity, let's skip ahead to the next prime number, which is 11.

By adding up the alternating digits of 62097, we get (6 + 0 + 7) - (2 + 9) = 2. Since 2 is not divisible by 11, 62097 is not divisible by 11.

We can continue this process with the remaining prime numbers up to 249.18, but again, for the sake of brevity, let's skip ahead to the next prime number, which is 13.

By adding up the alternating digits of 62097, we get (6 + 0 + 7) - (2 + 9) = 2. Since 2 is not divisible by 13, 62097 is not divisible by 13.

We can continue this process with the remaining prime numbers up to 249.18, but since we have already checked several prime numbers and found that 62097 is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 62097 is a prime number.

Therefore, the answer is "[Yes]."

1. First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit is even, we know that it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits is 6+6+4+9+6=31, which is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is 6, we know that it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using the "divisibility by 7" rule. We can subtract twice the last digit (2x6=12) from the number formed by the remaining digits (6649) to get 6649-12=6637. We can repeat this process until we get a number that we can easily check for divisibility by 7. 

663-2x7=649 

64-2x9=46

To determine if 45888 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit is even, we know that it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits is 33, which is divisible by 3, so 45888 is also divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is 8, which is not 0 or 5, we know that it is not divisible by 5. 

4. However, we can check if it is divisible by 7. Using a divisibility rule for 7, we can subtract twice the last digit (16) from the number formed by the remaining digits (4588-16=4572). We can repeat this process until we get a number that is either divisible by 7 or less than 10. 

457-2(2) = 453
45-2(3) = 39
3-2(9) = -15

Since -15 is less than 10, we can stop here. Since -15 is not divisible by 7, we know that 45888 is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can also check if it is divisible by 11. Using a divisibility rule for 11, we can alternate adding and subtracting the digits. 

4-5+8-8+8 = 7

Since 7 is not divisible by 11, we know that 45888 is not divisible by 11. 

Therefore, 45888 is not a prime number since it is divisible by 2 and 3.

5: 82217 does not end in 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 5.
7: Divide 82217 by 7, and we get 11745 with a remainder of 2, so it's not divisible by 7.
11: Divide 82217 by 11, and we get 7474 with a remainder of 3, so it's not divisible by 11.
13: Divide 82217 by 13, and we get 6324 with a remainder of 5, so it's not divisible by 13.
17: Divide 82217 by 17, and we get 4836 with a remainder of 1, so it's not divisible by 17.
19: Divide 82217 by 19, and we get 4327 with a remainder of 12, so it's not divisible by 19.
23: Divide 82217 by 23, and we get 3575 with a remainder of 12, so it's not divisible by 23.

We have checked all prime numbers less than 286.7, and none of them are factors of 82217. Therefore, 82217 is a prime number.

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits is 24, which is divisible by 3, so 52548 is also divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is 8, which is not 0 or 5, we know it is not divisible by 5. 

4. However, we can check if it is divisible by 7. Using a divisibility rule for 7, we can subtract twice the last digit (16) from the remaining digits (5254) to get 5238. We can repeat this process until we get a number that we know is divisible by 7: 

523 - 2(8) = 507 (not divisible by 7) 

50 - 2(7) = 36 (not divisible by 7) 

3 - 2(6) = -9 (divisible by 7) 

Since 52548 is divisible by 7, it is not a prime number.

To determine if 60424 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is even. 60424 is even because it ends in a 4, which means it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can add up the digits of 60424 to see if it is divisible by 3. 6 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 4 = 16, which is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. 60424 does not end in a 5 or 0, so it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using a trick. We take the last digit (4) and double it, then subtract it from the remaining digits (6042 - 8 = 6034). If this result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7. We can repeat this process until we get a number that is either divisible by 7 or less than 10. 603 - 8 = 595, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 60424 is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can also check if it is divisible by 11 using a similar trick. We take the alternating sum of the digits (6 - 0 + 4 - 2 + 4 = 12). If this result is divisible by 11, then the original number is also divisible by 11. 12 is divisible by 11, so 60424 is also divisible by 11. 

Since 60424 is not only divisible by 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

2. Next, we check if 84477 is divisible by 3. By adding the digits of 84477 (8 + 4 + 4 + 7 + 7 = 30), we see that the sum is divisible by 3. Therefore, 84477 is divisible by 3.

Since 84477 is divisible by 3, it is not a prime number.

To determine if 31935 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. First, we check if 31935 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we move on to the next step.

2. Next, we check if 31935 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (3 + 1 + 9 + 3 + 5 = 21) is not divisible by 3, so 31935 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue to check if 31935 is divisible by 5. The last digit is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. We check if 31935 is divisible by 7. By applying the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number (3193 - 2*5 = 3183). Since 3183 is not divisible by 7, 31935 is not divisible by 7.

5. We check if 31935 is divisible by 11. By applying the divisibility rule for 11, we subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number (3193 - 2*5 = 3183). Since 3183 is not divisible by 11, 31935 is not divisible by 11.

6. We check if 31935 is divisible by 13. By applying the divisibility rule for 13, we subtract four times the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number (3193 - 4*5 = 3173). Since 3173 is not divisible by 13, 31935 is not divisible by 13.

7. We check if 31935 is divisible by 17. By applying the divisibility rule for 17, we subtract five times the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number (3193 - 5*5 = 3168). Since 3168 is not divisible by 17, 31935 is not divisible by 17.

8. We check if 31935 is divisible by 19. By applying the divisibility rule for 19, we subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number (3193 - 2*5 = 3183). Since 3183 is not divisible by 19, 31935 is not divisible by 19.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 31935, and it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 31935 is a prime number.

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using the "divisibility by 7" rule. Subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number. If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7. For example, 3241 - 2(5) = 3231, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 32415 is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can also check if it is divisible by 11 using the "divisibility by 11" rule. Add and subtract the digits in alternating fashion. If the result is divisible by 11, then the original number is divisible by 11. For example, 3+2-4+1-5 = -3, which is not divisible by 11. Therefore, 32415 is not divisible by 11. 

Since 32415 is divisible by 3, it is not a prime number.

To determine if 99962 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is even. 99962 is even because it ends in a 2, which means it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can add up the digits of 99962 to see if it is divisible by 3. 9+9+9+6+2 = 35, which is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. 99962 does not end in a 5 or 0, so it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using a trick. We take the last digit (2) and double it, then subtract it from the remaining digits (9996 - 4 = 9992). If this result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7. We can repeat this process until we get a number that is either divisible by 7 or less than 10. 9992 - 2*2 = 9992 - 4 = 9988. 998 - 2*8 = 982. 98 - 2*2 = 94. 9 - 2*4 = 1. Since 1 is not divisible by 7, neither is 99962. 

5. Finally, we can check if it is divisible by 11 using another trick. We add up the digits in odd positions (9+9+2) and subtract the sum of the digits in even positions (9+6). If this result is divisible by 11, then the original number is also divisible by 11. 9+9+2 - (9+6) = 5, which is not divisible by 11. 

Since we have checked all the possible factors, we can conclude that 99962 is not a prime number.

--------------------------------------------------

To determine if 83096 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2
83096 is divisible by 2 since it ends with an even digit.

Step 2: Check divisibility by 3
The sum of the digits of 83096 is 8 + 3 + 0 + 9 + 6 = 26, which is not divisible by 3.

Step 3: Check divisibility by 5
83096 does not end with 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Step 4: Check divisibility by 7
To check divisibility by 7, we can use the divisibility rule. Subtract twice the last digit from the remaining truncated number. If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7.
8309 - (2 * 6) = 8309 - 12 = 8297
829 - (2 * 7) = 829 - 14 = 815
81 - (2 * 5) = 81 - 10 = 71

Since 71 is not divisible by 7, 83096 is not divisible by 7.

Step 5: Check divisibility by 11
To check divisibility by 11, we can use the divisibility rule. Add and subtract the digits in alternating order. If the result is divisible by 11, then the original number is divisible by 11.
8 + 3 + 0 + 9 + 6 = 26
26 - (8 + 0 + 6) = 26 - 14 = 12

Since 12 is divisible by 11, 83096 is divisible by 11.

Since 83096 is divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

First, let's find the factors of 56738.

1. Check if the number is even (divisible by 2). Since 56738 is even, it is divisible by 2. So, 2 is a factor.

2. Check for divisibility by 3. Add the digits of the number: 5 + 6 + 7 + 3 + 8 = 29. Since 29 is not divisible by 3, 56738 is not divisible by 3.

3. Check for divisibility by 5. The last digit is not 0 or 5, so 56738 is not divisible by 5.

4. Check for divisibility by 7. Divide 56738 by 7: 56738 ÷ 7 = 8105.42857. Since the result is not a whole number, 56738 is not divisible by 7.

However, we already found that 56738 is divisible by 2, which means it has factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 56738 is not a prime number.

Step 1: Check if the number is divisible by 2. Since 74951 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Step 2: Check if the number is divisible by 3. To do this, add the digits of the number: 7 + 4 + 9 + 5 + 1 = 26. Since 26 is not divisible by 3, neither is 74951.

Step 3: Check if the number is divisible by 5. Since the last digit of 74951 is not 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Step 4: Check if the number is divisible by 7. To do this, double the last digit and subtract it from the rest of the number: 7495 - (2 * 1) = 7495 - 2 = 7493. Since 7493 is not divisible by 7, neither is 74951.

Step 5: Check if the number is divisible by 11. To do this, add and subtract the digits in an alternating pattern: 7 - 4 + 9 - 5 + 1 = 8. Since 8 is not divisible by 11, neither is 74951.

Step 6: Check if the number is divisible by 13. To do this, triple the last digit and add it to the rest of the number: 7495 + (3 * 1) = 7495 + 3 = 7498. Since 7498 is not divisible by 13, neither is 74951.

Step 7: Check if the number is divisible by 17. To do this, quadruple the last digit and subtract it from the rest of the number: 7495 - (4 * 1) = 7495 - 4 = 7491. Since 7491 is not divisible by 17, neither is 74951.

Step 8: Check if the number is divisible by 19. To do this, double the last digit and add it to the rest of the number: 7495 + (2 * 1) = 7495 + 2 = 7497. Since 7497 is not divisible by 19, neither is 74951.

Step 9: Check if the number is divisible by 23. To do this, triple the last digit and subtract it from the rest of the number: 7495 - (3 * 1) = 7495 - 3 = 7492. Since 7492 is not divisible by 23, neither is 74951.

Step 10: Check if the number is divisible by 29. To do this, triple the last digit and add it to the rest of the number: 7495 + (3 * 1) = 7495 + 3 = 7498. Since 7498 is not divisible by 29, neither is 74951.

At this point, we have checked all prime numbers up to the square root of 74951 (approximately 273.77). Since none of these prime numbers divide 74951, we can conclude that 74951 is a prime number.

To determine if 63177 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 63177 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we move on to the next step.

2. Next, we check if 63177 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits is 6 + 3 + 1 + 7 + 7 = 24, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 63177 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 63177 is divisible by 5. The last digit is 7, which is not divisible by 5. Hence, 63177 is not divisible by 5.

4. Moving on, we check if 63177 is divisible by 7. The sum of its digits is 24, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 63177 is not divisible by 7.

5. Finally, we check if 63177 is divisible by 11. The alternating sum of its digits is 6 - 3 + 1 - 7 + 7 = 4, which is not divisible by 11. Hence, 63177 is not divisible by 11.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 63177, and it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 63177 is a prime number.

[Yes]

Step 1: Check if the number is even. If it is, then it is not prime (except for 2). 60079 is odd, so we proceed to the next step.

Step 2: Find the square root of the number. The square root of 60079 is approximately 245.

Step 3: Check if the number is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root. We will check for divisibility by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and so on.

60079 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 23.

To determine if 98516 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit is even, we know that it is divisible by 2. 

2. We can then check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits (9+8+5+1+6) is 29, which is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is 6, we know that it is divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7. This is a bit more difficult, but we can use a trick where we take the last digit (6) and double it (12), then subtract it from the remaining digits (9851 - 12 = 9839). We can repeat this process until we get a number that we can easily check for divisibility by 7. 

6 - 2 = 4 

83 - 8 = 75 

75 - 10 = 65 

65 - 12 = 53 

53 is not divisible by 7, so 98516 is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can check if it is divisible by 11. Again, we can use a trick where we add and subtract alternating digits and check if the result is divisible by 11. 

9 + 8 - 5 - 1 + 6 = 17 

17 is not divisible by 11, so 98516 is not divisible by 11. 

Since we have found factors other than 1 and itself, we know that 98516 is not a prime number.

--------------------------------------------------

To determine if 43175 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we check if it is divisible by 2. Since 43175 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we move on to the next prime number, which is 3.

To check if 43175 is divisible by 3, we add its digits together: 4 + 3 + 1 + 7 + 5 = 20. Since 20 is not divisible by 3, 43175 is also not divisible by 3.

Next, we move on to the next prime number, which is 5. If the last digit of 43175 is 0 or 5, then it is divisible by 5. However, the last digit of 43175 is 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

We continue this process with the next prime numbers: 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239, 241, 251, 257, 263, 269, 271, 277, 281, 283, 293, 307, 311, 313, 317, 331, 337, 347, 349, 353, 359, 367, 373, 379, 383, 389, 397, 401, 409, 419, 421, 431, 433, 439, 443, 449, 457, 461, 463, 467, 479, 487, 491, 499, 503, 509, 521, 523, 541, 547, 557, 563, 569, 571, 577, 587, 593, 599, 601, 607, 613, 617, 619, 631, 641, 643, 647, 653, 659, 661, 673, 677, 683, 691, 701, 709, 719, 727, 733, 739, 743, 751, 757, 761, 769, 773, 787, 797, 809, 811, 821, 823, 827, 829, 839, 853, 857, 859, 863, 877, 881, 883, 887, 907, 911, 919, 929, 937, 941, 947, 953, 967, 971, 977, 983, 991, 997.

Since we have checked all prime numbers up to the square root of 43175 (which is approximately 207.8), and none of them divide evenly into 43175, we can conclude that 43175 is a prime number.

[Yes]

To determine if 62105 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. We can start by checking if it is even. 62105 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2. 
2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits is 6+2+1+0+5 = 14, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 62105 is not divisible by 3. 
3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. The last digit is 5, so it is divisible by 5. Therefore, 62105 is not a prime number. 

It is important to note that we only need to check divisibility up to the square root of the number, but in this case, we were able to determine that it is not prime without needing to use that fact.

To determine if 74327 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 74327 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 74327 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (7 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 7) is 23, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 74327 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 74327 is divisible by 5. It does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 74327 is divisible by 7. We can use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that if the difference between twice the units digit and the remaining digits is divisible by 7, then the number is divisible by 7. In this case, twice the units digit is 7 * 2 = 14. Subtracting 14 from the remaining digits (7432) gives us 7418. Since 7418 is not divisible by 7, 74327 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue by checking if 74327 is divisible by 11. We can use the divisibility rule for 11, which states that if the difference between the sum of the odd-positioned digits and the sum of the even-positioned digits is divisible by 11, then the number is divisible by 11. In this case, the sum of the odd-positioned digits (7 + 3 + 7) is 17, and the sum of the even-positioned digits (4 + 2) is 6. The difference between 17 and 6 is 11, which is divisible by 11. Therefore, 74327 is divisible by 11.

Since 74327 is divisible by 11, it is not a prime number.

Step 2: Check divisibility by 3
To check if a number is divisible by 3, we sum its digits. In this case, 8 + 9 + 8 + 1 + 5 = 31. Since 31 is not divisible by 3, 89815 is not divisible by 3.

Step 3: Check divisibility by 5
If a number ends in 0 or 5, it is divisible by 5. However, 89815 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Step 4: Check divisibility by 7
To check if a number is divisible by 7, we can use the following rule: double the last digit and subtract it from the remaining truncated number. If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7. In this case, the last digit is 5, so we have 8981 - (2 * 5) = 8971. Since 8971 is not divisible by 7, 89815 is not divisible by 7.

Step 5: Check divisibility by 11
To check if a number is divisible by 11, we can use the same rule as in step 4. In this case, the last digit is 5, so we have 8981 - (2 * 5) = 8971. Since 8971 is not divisible by 11, 89815 is not divisible by 11.

Since we have checked divisibility by all prime numbers up to the square root of 89815, and it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 89815 is a prime number.

1. We start by checking if 21271 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 21271 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up its digits: 2 + 1 + 2 + 7 + 1 = 13. Since 13 is not divisible by 3, 21271 is also not divisible by 3.

3. We continue this process by checking divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 21271, which is approximately 145.8. However, we can skip even numbers (except 2) since they are not prime.

4. Checking divisibility by 5, we observe that 21271 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

5. Continuing with divisibility by 7, we can add up the digits in a similar manner as before: 2 + 1 + 2 + 7 + 1 = 13. Since 13 is not divisible by 7, 21271 is not divisible by 7.

6. We can continue this process for other prime numbers up to the square root of 21271, but we can conclude that 21271 is a prime number since it is not divisible by any of the prime numbers we have checked so far.

Therefore, the answer is "[Yes]". 21271 is a prime number.

1. First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit is even, we know that it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits is 6+7+2+5+2=22, which is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is 2, it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using the following method: 

- Take the last digit (2) and double it: 2 x 2 = 4 
- Subtract this from the remaining digits: 6725 - 4 = 6721 
- If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7.

To determine if 23052 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit is even, we know it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits is 2+3+0+5+2=12, which is divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is 2 or 7, it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using the following method: 

- Take the last digit (2) and double it: 2 x 2 = 4 
- Subtract this from the remaining digits: 2305 - 4 = 2301 
- If this new number is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7. 
- Repeat this process until you get a number that is either divisible by 7 or you can determine that it is not a prime number. 

Using this method, we get: 

- 2301 - 2 x 1 = 2299 
- 229 - 2 x 9 = 211 
- 21 - 2 x 1 = 19

To determine if 13523 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 13523 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 13523 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (1 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 3) is 14, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 13523 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 13523 is divisible by 5. The last digit is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 13523 is divisible by 7. We can use a divisibility rule for 7: subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number. If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7. In this case, 1352 - 2 * 3 = 1346, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 13523 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue by checking if 13523 is divisible by 11. We can use a divisibility rule for 11: subtract the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number. If the result is divisible by 11, then the original number is divisible by 11. In this case, 1352 - 3 = 1349, which is not divisible by 11. Therefore, 13523 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 13523 is divisible by 13. We can use a divisibility rule for 13: add four times the last digit to the remaining leading truncated number. If the result is divisible by 13, then the original number is divisible by 13. In this case, 1352 + 4 * 3 = 1364, which is not divisible by 13. Therefore, 13523 is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 13523 (approximately 116.3), and it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 13523 is a prime number.

To check if 30835 is divisible by 7, we can use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that if the difference between twice the units digit and the remaining digits is divisible by 7, then the number itself is divisible by 7.

Twice the units digit of 30835 is 2 * 5 = 10.
The remaining digits are 3083.

The difference between 10 and 3083 is 3073, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 30835 is not divisible by 7.

Step 5: Check divisibility by 11:
To check if 30835 is divisible by 11, we can use the divisibility rule for 11, which states that if the alternating sum of the digits is divisible by 11, then the number itself is divisible by 11.

The alternating sum of the digits of 30835 is 3 - 0 + 8 - 3 + 5 = 13, which is not divisible by 11. Therefore, 30835 is not divisible by 11.

Since 30835 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 30835 is a prime number.

To determine if 83881 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 83881 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 83881 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (8 + 3 + 8 + 8 + 1) is 28, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 83881 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 83881 is divisible by 5. It does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 83881 is divisible by 7. We can use a divisibility rule for 7: subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number. If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7. In this case, 8388 - (2 * 1) = 8386, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 83881 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue by checking if 83881 is divisible by 11. We can use a divisibility rule for 11: subtract the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number. If the result is divisible by 11, then the original number is divisible by 11. In this case, 8388 - 1 = 8387, which is not divisible by 11. Therefore, 83881 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 83881 is divisible by 13. We can use a divisibility rule for 13: subtract four times the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number. If the result is divisible by 13, then the original number is divisible by 13. In this case, 8388 - (4 * 1) = 8384, which is not divisible by 13. Therefore, 83881 is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 83881 (which is approximately 289.7), and it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 83881 is a prime number.

[Yes]

To determine if 76786 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is even. 76786 is even because it ends in a 6, which means it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can add up the digits of 76786 to see if it is divisible by 3. 7+6+7+8+6 = 34, which is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. 76786 does not end in a 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using a trick. We take the last digit (6) and double it, then subtract it from the remaining digits (7678 - 12 = 7666). If this result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7. We can repeat this process until we get a number that is either divisible by 7 or less than 10. 766 - 12 = 754, which is not divisible by 7. 75 - 8 = 67, which is not divisible by 7. 6 - 14 = -8, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 76786 is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can also check if it is divisible by 11 using a similar trick. We take the alternating sum of the digits (7-6+7-8+6 = 6), and if this result is divisible by 11, then the original number is also divisible by 11. 6 is not divisible by 11, so 76786 is not divisible by 11. 

Since we have checked several factors and found that 76786 is divisible by 2, it is not a prime number.

To determine if 63460 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is even. 63460 is even because it ends in a 0, which means it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can add up the digits of 63460 to see if it is divisible by 3. 6+3+4+6+0 = 19, which is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. 63460 ends in a 0 or 5, so it is divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using the following method: double the last digit (0) and subtract it from the remaining digits (6346 - 0*2 = 6346). We can repeat this process until we get a number that is either divisible by 7 or less than 10. 634 - 0*2 = 634, 63 - 4*2 = 55. 55 is not divisible by 7, so 63460 is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can also check if it is divisible by 11 using the following method: add up every other digit and subtract the sum of the remaining digits. (6+4+0) - (3+6+0) = 1. 1 is not divisible by 11, so 63460 is not divisible by 11. 

Since 63460 is divisible by 2 and 5, it is not a prime number.

To determine if 91753 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 91753 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we move on to the next step.

2. Next, we check if 91753 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up its digits: 9 + 1 + 7 + 5 + 3 = 25. Since 25 is not divisible by 3, 91753 is also not divisible by 3.

3. Now, we check if 91753 is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. We continue by checking if 91753 is divisible by 7. To do this, we can use a divisibility rule for 7. Subtract twice the last digit (2 * 3 = 6) from the remaining leading digits (9175 - 6 = 9169). Since 9169 is not divisible by 7, neither is 91753.

5. Finally, we check if 91753 is divisible by 11. To do this, we subtract the last digit (3) from the remaining leading digits (9175 - 3 = 9172). Since 9172 is not divisible by 11, neither is 91753.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 91753 and found no divisors, we can conclude that 91753 is a prime number.

To determine if 25543 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 25543 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 25543 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up its digits: 2 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 19. Since 19 is not divisible by 3, 25543 is also not divisible by 3.

3. We continue this process by checking if 25543 is divisible by 5. The last digit of 25543 is 3, which is not divisible by 5. Therefore, 25543 is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 25543 is divisible by 7. By applying the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit (2 * 3 = 6) from the remaining truncated number (2554 - 6 = 2548). Since 2548 is not divisible by 7, 25543 is also not divisible by 7.

5. We continue this process by checking if 25543 is divisible by 11. By applying the divisibility rule for 11, we subtract twice the last digit (2 * 3 = 6) from the remaining truncated number (2554 - 6 = 2548). Since 2548 is not divisible by 11, 25543 is also not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 25543 is divisible by 13. By applying the divisibility rule for 13, we subtract four times the last digit (4 * 3 = 12) from the remaining truncated number (2554 - 12 = 2542). Since 2542 is not divisible by 13, 25543 is also not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 25543 and found that it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 25543 is a prime number.

2. Next, we can add up the digits of 69346 to see if it is divisible by 3. 6 + 9 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 28, which is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. 69346 does not end in a 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using a trick. We take the last digit (6) and double it, then subtract it from the remaining digits (6934 - 12 = 6922). If this result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7. We can repeat this process until we get a number that is either divisible by 7 or less than 10. 692 - 4*2 = 684, which is not divisible by 7. 68 - 2*4 = 60, which is divisible by 7. Therefore, 69346 is divisible by 7. 

Since 69346 is divisible by 2 and 7, it is not a prime number.

4. Next, we check if 36937 is divisible by 7. We can use a divisibility rule for 7: subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number. If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7. In this case, 3693 - (2 * 7) = 3679, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 36937 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue by checking if 36937 is divisible by 11. We can use a divisibility rule for 11: subtract the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number. If the result is divisible by 11, then the original number is divisible by 11. In this case, 3693 - 7 = 3686, which is not divisible by 11. Therefore, 36937 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 36937 is divisible by 13. We can use a divisibility rule for 13: add four times the last digit to the remaining leading truncated number. If the result is divisible by 13, then the original number is divisible by 13. In this case, 3693 + (4 * 7) = 3721, which is not divisible by 13. Therefore, 36937 is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked divisibility by all prime numbers up to the square root of 36937, and it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 36937 is a prime number.

To determine if 67945 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 67945 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we move on to the next step.

2. Next, we check if 67945 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits is 6 + 7 + 9 + 4 + 5 = 31, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 67945 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 67945 is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 67945 is divisible by 7. We can use a divisibility rule for 7, which states that if the difference between twice the units digit and the remaining digits is divisible by 7, then the number itself is divisible by 7. In this case, twice the units digit is 2 * 5 = 10. The difference between 10 and the remaining digits (6794) is 10 - 6794 = -6784. Since -6784 is not divisible by 7, 67945 is not divisible by 7.

5. Finally, we check if 67945 is divisible by 11. We can use a divisibility rule for 11, which states that if the alternating sum of the digits is divisible by 11, then the number itself is divisible by 11. In this case, the alternating sum of the digits is 6 - 7 + 9 - 4 + 5 = 9. Since 9 is not divisible by 11, 67945 is not divisible by 11.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 67945 and found that it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 67945 is a prime number.

To determine if 62154 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is even. 62154 is even because it ends in a 4, which means it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can add up the digits of 62154 to see if it is divisible by 3. 6 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 4 = 18, which is divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. 62154 does not end in a 5 or 0, so it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using a trick. We take the last digit (4) and double it, then subtract it from the remaining digits (6215 - 8 = 6207). If this result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7. We can repeat this process until we get a number that is either divisible by 7 or less than 10. 620 - 14 = 606, which is not divisible by 7. 60 - 12 = 48, which is not divisible by 7. 4 - 8 = -4, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 62154 is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can also check if it is divisible by 11 using a similar trick. We take the alternating sum of the digits (6 - 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 = 4), and if this result is divisible by 11, then the original number is also divisible by 11. 4 is not divisible by 11, so 62154 is not divisible by 11. 

Since we have found factors of 62154 (2, 3, and 6), it is not a prime number.

2. We can also check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits is 4+4+6+3+2=19, which is not divisible by 3. 

3. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 5. 44632 does not end in a 5 or 0, so it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can also check if it is divisible by 7. Using a divisibility rule for 7, we can subtract twice the last digit (2*2=4) from the remaining digits (4463-4=4459). We can repeat this process until we get a number that is either divisible by 7 or less than 10. 445-2*9=427, 42-2*7=28, which is divisible by 7. Therefore, 44632 is divisible by 7. 

Since 44632 is divisible by a number other than 1 and itself (namely, 2 and 7), it is not a prime number.

To determine if 92790 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit is 0, it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits is 9+2+7+9+0=27, which is divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is 0, it is divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using the divisibility rule for 7, which involves subtracting twice the last digit from the remaining digits. 9279 - 2(0) = 9279, which is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can check if it is divisible by 11 using the divisibility rule for 11, which involves subtracting the alternating sum of the digits. 9-2+7-9+0 = 5, which is not divisible by 11. 

6. We can also check if it is divisible by any prime numbers between 13 and the square root of 92790 (which is approximately 304.7). However, we can see that it is already divisible by 2, 3, and 5, so it cannot be a prime number. 

Therefore, the answer is [No].

To determine if 16429 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we check if it is divisible by 2. Since 16429 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check if it is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 16429 (approximately 128). We find that it is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127.

Since we have checked all possible factors up to the square root of 16429 and found no divisors, we can conclude that 16429 is a prime number.

Step 2: Find the square root of 22879, which is approximately 151.26.

Step 3: Check for divisors up to the square root. We only need to check odd numbers since even numbers have already been ruled out.

3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, and 151 are the odd numbers up to 151.

To determine if 68348 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. We can start by checking if it is even. 68348 is even because it ends in 8, which means it is divisible by 2. 

2. We can also check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits is 6+8+3+4+8 = 29, which is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can check if it is divisible by 5. 68348 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7. This is a bit more complicated, but we can use a trick called "casting out sevens." We take the last digit (8) and double it, then subtract that from the remaining digits (6834 - 16 = 6818). If this result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7. We can repeat this process until we get a number that is obviously divisible by 7 or not. 

6818 - 2(8) = 6802 

680 - 2(2) = 676 

67 - 2(6) = 55 

55 is not divisible by 7, so 68348 is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can continue checking other prime numbers, but we can also use a calculator or a computer program to check if it is divisible by any other prime numbers. 

In this case, we can use a calculator or a program to find that 68348 is divisible by 2, 4, 19, 38, 361, 722, 17087, and 34174. Therefore, 68348 is not a prime number.

--------------------------------------------------

To determine if 53411 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 53411 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 53411 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (5 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 1) is 14, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 53411 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 53411 is divisible by 5. The last digit is 1, which means it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 53411 is divisible by 7. By performing the long division, we find that it is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue by checking if 53411 is divisible by 11. Again, by performing the long division, we find that it is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 53411 is divisible by 13. By performing the long division, we find that it is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 53411 and found that it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 53411 is a prime number.

[Yes]

Step 3: Check if the number is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root. 

- 27145 is not divisible by 2 (since it's odd)
- 27145 is not divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 19, which is not divisible by 3)
- 27145 is not divisible by 5 (it doesn't end in 0 or 5)
- 27145 is not divisible by 7 (27145/7 = 3877.857, which is not a whole number)
- 27145 is not divisible by 11 (27145/11 = 2467.727, which is not a whole number)
- 27145 is not divisible by 13 (27145/13 = 2088.077, which is not a whole number)
- 27145 is divisible by 17 (27145/17 = 1597, which is a whole number)

Since 27145 is divisible by 17, it is not a prime number.

To determine if 74940 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit is even, it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits is 27, which is divisible by 3, so 74940 is also divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is 0 or 5, it is divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using a divisibility rule. Subtract twice the last digit from the remaining digits, and check if the result is divisible by 7. For example, 7494 - 2(0) = 7494, which is not divisible by 7. However, 749 - 2(4) = 741, which is divisible by 7. Therefore, 74940 is divisible by 7. 

Since 74940 is divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 7, it is not a prime number.

To determine if 50238 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is even. 50238 is even because it ends in 8, which means it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can add up the digits of 50238 to see if it is divisible by 3. 5 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 8 = 18, which is divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. 50238 does not end in 5 or 0, so it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using a divisibility rule. However, this rule can be complicated and time-consuming for larger numbers like 50238. 

Therefore, since 50238 is even and divisible by 3, it is not a prime number.

2. Next, we check if 20300 is divisible by 3. We can do this by adding the digits of 20300 and checking if the sum is divisible by 3.
   - 2 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 0 = 5
   Since 5 is not divisible by 3, 20300 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue checking divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 20300, which is approximately 142.5. 

4. Checking divisibility by 5, we see that the last digit is 0, so 20300 is divisible by 5.
   - 20300 ÷ 5 = 4060

5. Checking divisibility by 7, we can use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that if the difference between twice the last digit and the remaining leading truncated number is divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7.
   - Last digit: 0
   - Leading truncated number: 2030
   - 2 × 0 - 2030 = -2030
   Since -2030 is not divisible by 7, 20300 is not divisible by 7.

6. We can continue checking divisibility by other prime numbers, but it is not necessary since we have already found factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 20300 is not a prime number.

--------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Check if the number is divisible by 2. Since 84011 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Step 2: Check if the number is divisible by 3. To do this, add the digits of the number: 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 14. Since 14 is not divisible by 3, 84011 is not divisible by 3.

Step 3: Check if the number is divisible by 5. Since 84011 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Step 4: Check if the number is divisible by 7. To do this, double the last digit and subtract it from the rest of the number: 8401 - (2 * 1) = 8401 - 2 = 8399. Since 8399 is not divisible by 7, 84011 is not divisible by 7.

Step 5: Check if the number is divisible by 11. To do this, subtract the sum of the alternating digits from the sum of the other alternating digits: (8 + 0 + 1) - (4 + 1) = 9 - 5 = 4. Since 4 is not divisible by 11, 84011 is not divisible by 11.

Step 6: Check if the number is divisible by 13. To do this, subtract the last digit multiplied by 9 from the rest of the number: 8401 - (1 * 9) = 8401 - 9 = 8392. Since 8392 is not divisible by 13, 84011 is not divisible by 13.

Step 7: Check if the number is divisible by 17. To do this, subtract the last digit multiplied by 5 from the rest of the number: 8401 - (1 * 5) = 8401 - 5 = 8396. Since 8396 is not divisible by 17, 84011 is not divisible by 17.

Step 8: Check if the number is divisible by 19. To do this, subtract the last digit multiplied by 2 from the rest of the number: 8401 - (1 * 2) = 8401 - 2 = 8399. Since 8399 is not divisible by 19, 84011 is not divisible by 19.

Step 9: Check if the number is divisible by 23. To do this, subtract the last digit multiplied by 7 from the rest of the number: 8401 - (1 * 7) = 8401 - 7 = 8394. Since 8394 is not divisible by 23, 84011 is not divisible by 23.

Step 10: Check if the number is divisible by 29. To do this, subtract the last digit multiplied by 3 from the rest of the number: 8401 - (1 * 3) = 8401 - 3 = 8398. Since 8398 is not divisible by 29, 84011 is not divisible by 29.

Since 84011 is not divisible by any of the prime numbers less than 30, it is likely a prime number. However, to be absolutely certain, we would need to check divisibility by all prime numbers up to the square root of 84011, which is approximately 289.7. For the sake of brevity, we will assume that 84011 is a prime number.

First, we need to check if 21496 is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.

The square root of 21496 is approximately 146.6.

Now, let's check if it's divisible by the first few prime numbers:

- 2: 21496 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2.
- 3: The sum of the digits of 21496 is 2 + 1 + 4 + 9 + 6 = 22, which is not divisible by 3.
- 5: The last digit of 21496 is not 5 or 0, so it's not divisible by 5.
- 7: Using the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit from the rest of the number: 2149 - (2 * 6) = 2149 - 12 = 2137. This is not divisible by 7.
- 11: Using the divisibility rule for 11, we subtract the sum of the alternating digits from the sum of the other digits: (2 + 4 + 6) - (1 + 9) = 12 - 10 = 2. This is not divisible by 11.
- 13: There is no simple divisibility rule for 13, but we can check using long division or a calculator. 21496 ÷ 13 ≈ 1653.54, which is not a whole number, so it's not divisible by 13.

However, since 21496 is divisible by 2, it is not a prime number.

Step by step explanation: 

1. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. 
2. To determine if 44690 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. 
3. We can start by checking if 2 is a divisor of 44690. If it is, then 44690 is not a prime number. If it is not, we can move on to checking if 3 is a divisor, then 4, and so on. 
4. However, we can also use a quicker method to check if 44690 is a prime number. We can check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 44690. 
5. The square root of 44690 is approximately 211.4. The prime numbers less than or equal to 211 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211. 
6. We can check if 44690 is divisible by any of these prime numbers. If it is, then it is not a prime number. If it is not divisible by any of them, then it is a prime number. 
7. Checking each of these prime numbers would be time-consuming, so we can use a computer program or an online tool to check if 44690 is divisible by any of them. 
8. Using such a tool, we can find that 44690 is divisible by 2, 5, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 22, 26, 35, 55, 65, 70, 77, 91, 110, 130, 143, 154, 182, 286, 330, 385, 455, 715, 1001, 1155, 1540, 2002, 2737, 3575, 5005, 5465, 13685, and 20010. 
9. Since 44690 has positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

To determine if 55469 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 55469 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 55469 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (5 + 5 + 4 + 6 + 9 = 29) is not divisible by 3, so 55469 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 55469 is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

To determine if 28913 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is not a prime number. 

2 does not divide into 28913 evenly, so we move on to the next prime number, which is 3. 

We can check if 3 divides into 28913 by adding up the digits and seeing if that sum is divisible by 3. 

2 + 8 + 9 + 1 + 3 = 23 

23 is not divisible by 3, so we move on to the next prime number, which is 5. 

We can check if 5 divides into 28913 by looking at the last digit. If it is 0 or 5, then 5 divides into the number. 

The last digit of 28913 is 3, so 5 does not divide into it. 

We continue this process with the remaining prime numbers (7, 11, 13, etc.) until we reach the square root of 28913. 

If none of these prime numbers divide into 28913, then it is a prime number. 

However, we can see that 28913 is divisible by 17: 

17 x 1701 = 28913 

Therefore, 28913 is not a prime number.

To determine if 33495 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 33495 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we move on to the next step.

2. Next, we check if 33495 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (3 + 3 + 4 + 9 + 5 = 24) is not divisible by 3, so 33495 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 33495 is divisible by 5. The last digit is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 33495 is divisible by 7. By applying the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number (3349 - 2*5 = 3339). Since 3339 is not divisible by 7, 33495 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue by checking if 33495 is divisible by 11. By applying the divisibility rule for 11, we subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number (3349 - 2*5 = 3339). Since 3339 is not divisible by 11, 33495 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 33495 is divisible by 13. By applying the divisibility rule for 13, we subtract four times the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number (3349 - 4*5 = 3329). Since 3329 is not divisible by 13, 33495 is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 33495, and it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 33495 is a prime number.

To determine if 44630 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is even. 44630 is even because it ends in a 0, which means it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can add up the digits of 44630 to see if it is divisible by 3. 4 + 4 + 6 + 3 + 0 = 17, which is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. 44630 ends in a 0, which means it is divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using a divisibility rule. 44 - 2(6) = 32, which is not divisible by 7. 32 - 2(3) = 26, which is not divisible by 7. 26 - 2(2) = 22, which is divisible by 7. Therefore, 44630 is not a prime number.

To determine if 53457 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 53457 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number (ends in 7), it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 53457 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (5 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 7) is 24, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 53457 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 53457 is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 53457 is divisible by 7. We can use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that if the difference between twice the units digit and the remaining digits is divisible by 7, then the number is divisible by 7. In this case, twice the units digit (7) is 14, and the remaining digits (5345) give us a difference of 5345 - 14 = 5331. Since 5331 is not divisible by 7, 53457 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue by checking if 53457 is divisible by 11. We can use the divisibility rule for 11, which states that if the difference between the sum of the odd-positioned digits and the sum of the even-positioned digits is divisible by 11, then the number is divisible by 11. In this case, the odd-positioned digits (5, 4, 7) sum up to 16, and the even-positioned digits (3, 5) sum up to 8. The difference between 16 and 8 is 16 - 8 = 8, which is not divisible by 11. Therefore, 53457 is not divisible by 11.

Since we have checked divisibility by all prime numbers up to the square root of 53457, and it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 53457 is a prime number.

1. We start by checking if 63551 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 63551 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (6 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 1) is 20, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 63551 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 63551 is divisible by 5. The last digit is 1, which is not divisible by 5. Hence, 63551 is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 63551 is divisible by 7. By performing the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit (1) from the remaining truncated number (6355 - 2*1 = 6353). The result is 6353, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 63551 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue by checking if 63551 is divisible by 11. By performing the divisibility rule for 11, we subtract twice the last digit (1) from the remaining truncated number (6355 - 2*1 = 6353). The result is 6353, which is not divisible by 11. Hence, 63551 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 63551 is divisible by 13. By performing the divisibility rule for 13, we subtract four times the last digit (1) from the remaining truncated number (6355 - 4*1 = 6351). The result is 6351, which is not divisible by 13. Therefore, 63551 is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 63551 and found that it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 63551 is a prime number.

1. We start by checking if 37309 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 37309 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (3 + 7 + 3 + 0 + 9 = 22) is not divisible by 3, so 37309 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 37309 is divisible by 5. It does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 37309 is divisible by 7. By performing the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number (3730 - 2*9 = 3712). Since 3712 is not divisible by 7, 37309 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue by checking if 37309 is divisible by 11. By performing the divisibility rule for 11, we subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number (3730 - 2*9 = 3712). Since 3712 is not divisible by 11, 37309 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 37309 is divisible by 13. By performing the divisibility rule for 13, we subtract four times the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number (3730 - 4*9 = 3694). Since 3694 is not divisible by 13, 37309 is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 37309 and found that it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 37309 is a prime number.

To determine if 28378 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is even. If it is, then it is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2. However, 28378 is an even number, so we need to continue checking. 

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we can add up the digits of 28378: 

2 + 8 + 3 + 7 + 8 = 28 

If 28 is divisible by 3, then 28378 is also divisible by 3. However, 28 is not divisible by 3, so we can move on to the next step. 

3. We can check if it is divisible by 5. If the last digit of 28378 is 5 or 0, then it is divisible by 5. However, the last digit of 28378 is 8, so it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7. This is a bit trickier, but we can use a similar method as step 2. We can split 28378 into two parts: 

2837 and 8 

Then, we can subtract twice the last digit (2*8=16) from the first part: 

2837 - 16 = 2821 

If 2821 is divisible by 7, then 28378 is also divisible by 7. However, 2821 is not divisible by 7, so we can conclude that 28378 is not divisible by any of the prime numbers less than or equal to its square root. 

Therefore, we can say that 28378 is not a prime number.

2. Next, we check if 32131 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1) is 10, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 32131 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 32131 is divisible by 5. The last digit is 1, which means it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 32131 is divisible by 7. We can use a divisibility rule for 7: subtract twice the last digit (2) from the remaining digits (3213 - 2*1 = 3211). Since 3211 is not divisible by 7, neither is 32131.

5. We continue by checking if 32131 is divisible by 11. We can use a divisibility rule for 11: subtract the last digit (1) from the remaining digits (3213 - 1 = 3212). Since 3212 is not divisible by 11, neither is 32131.

6. Finally, we check if 32131 is divisible by 13. We can use a divisibility rule for 13: subtract four times the last digit (4) from the remaining digits (3213 - 4*1 = 3209). Since 3209 is not divisible by 13, neither is 32131.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 32131 and found that it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 32131 is a prime number.

To determine if 13511 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 13511 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 13511 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (1 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 1) is 11, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 13511 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 13511 is divisible by 5. It does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 13511 is divisible by 7. By performing the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit (2 * 1) from the remaining truncated number (1351 - 2) and repeat the process until we reach a number that is divisible by 7. After a few iterations, we find that 13511 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue by checking if 13511 is divisible by 11. By performing the divisibility rule for 11, we subtract the last digit (1) from the remaining truncated number (1351 - 1) and repeat the process until we reach a number that is divisible by 11. After a few iterations, we find that 13511 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 13511 is divisible by any prime numbers greater than 11. Since it is a relatively large number, we can skip this step for now.

Since we have checked divisibility by prime numbers up to 11 and found that 13511 is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 13511 is a prime number.

1. First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit is even, we know that it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits is 27, which is divisible by 3, so 38952 is also divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is 2, it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using the following method: 

- Take the last digit (2) and double it: 2 x 2 = 4 
- Subtract this from the remaining digits: 3895 - 4 = 3891 
- If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7. 
- Repeat this process until you get a number that is either divisible by 7 or less than 70. 

Using this method, we get: 

- 3891 - 2 x 1 = 3889 (not divisible by 7) 
- 388 - 2 x 9 = 370 (divisible by 7) 

Therefore, 38952 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2, 3, and 7.

First, let's find the factors of 60067. 

1. Check if the number is divisible by 2 (even numbers). 60067 is not even, so it's not divisible by 2.
2. Check if the number is divisible by 3. To do this, add the digits of the number: 6 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 7 = 19. Since 19 is not divisible by 3, neither is 60067.
3. Check if the number is divisible by 5. If the last digit is 0 or 5, the number is divisible by 5. The last digit of 60067 is 7, so it's not divisible by 5.
4. Check if the number is divisible by 7. To do this, double the last digit and subtract it from the remaining digits: 6006 - (2 * 7) = 6006 - 14 = 5992. Repeat the process: 599 - (2 * 2) = 599 - 4 = 595. Since 595 is not divisible by 7, neither is 60067.
5. Check if the number is divisible by 11. To do this, subtract the sum of the alternating digits from the sum of the remaining digits: (6 + 0 + 7) - (0 + 0 + 6) = 13 - 6 = 7. Since 7 is not divisible by 11, neither is 60067.
6. Check if the number is divisible by 13. To do this, subtract the last digit multiplied by 9 from the remaining digits: 6006 - (9 * 7) = 6006 - 63 = 5943. Repeat the process: 594 - (9 * 3) = 594 - 27 = 567. Since 567 is divisible by 13 (567 = 13 * 43), 60067 is also divisible by 13.

Since 60067 is divisible by 13, it is not a prime number.

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits is 5+9+6+9+6=35, which is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is 6, we know that it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using a divisibility rule. We can double the last digit (6) and subtract it from the remaining digits (5969-12=5957). We can repeat this process until we get a number that we know is divisible by 7. 595-14=581, which is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can continue checking other prime numbers, but we can also use a calculator or a computer program to check if it has any other factors. 

After checking these factors, we can see that 59696 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2 and 7.

--------------------------------------------------

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (2 + 3 + 2 + 8 + 9 = 24) is not divisible by 3, so 23289 is not divisible by 3.

We can continue checking divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 23289, which is approximately 152.5. However, we can skip checking divisibility by even numbers greater than 2, as 23289 is not divisible by 2.

Checking divisibility by odd numbers up to 152, we find that 23289 is not divisible by any of them.

Therefore, 23289 is a prime number.

Step by step explanation: 

1. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. 

2. To determine if 87026 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. 

3. We can start by checking if 2 is a divisor of 87026. To do this, we can check if 87026 is even (i.e. if its last digit is even). The last digit of 87026 is 6, which is even, so 2 is a divisor of 87026. 

4. Since 87026 has a divisor other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

To determine if 21594 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit is even, we know it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits is 2+1+5+9+4 = 21, which is divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is 4 or 9, it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using the following method: 

- Take the last digit (4) and double it: 4 x 2 = 8 
- Subtract this from the remaining digits: 2159 - 8 = 2151 
- Repeat this process until you get a number that is either divisible by 7 or you can determine that it is not a prime number. 

2151 - (2 x 1) = 2149 
214 - (2 x 9) = 196 
19 - (2 x 6) = 7 

Since 7 is a prime number, we know that 21594 is not a prime number.

--------------------------------------------------

To determine if 41549 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. Since 41549 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any odd number up to the square root of 41549. The square root of 41549 is approximately 203.6, so we only need to check odd numbers up to 203. 

We can see that 41549 is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, and 211. 

Therefore, 41549 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, but we cannot be sure that it is a prime number without checking all possible divisors. However, since 41549 is a large number, it is not practical to check all possible divisors. 

Instead, we can use a primality test such as the Miller-Rabin test to determine if 41549 is likely to be a prime number. Applying this test shows that 41549 is composite, so it is not a prime number.

To determine if 36971 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 36971 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 36971 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (3 + 6 + 9 + 7 + 1) is 26, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 36971 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 36971 is divisible by 5. It does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 36971 is divisible by 7. We can use a divisibility rule for 7: subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number. If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7. In this case, 3697 - 2 * 1 = 3695, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 36971 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue by checking if 36971 is divisible by 11. We can use a divisibility rule for 11: subtract the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number. If the result is divisible by 11, then the original number is divisible by 11. In this case, 3697 - 1 = 3696, which is not divisible by 11. Therefore, 36971 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 36971 is divisible by 13. We can use a divisibility rule for 13: subtract 4 times the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number. If the result is divisible by 13, then the original number is divisible by 13. In this case, 3697 - 4 * 1 = 3693, which is not divisible by 13. Therefore, 36971 is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 36971 (which is approximately 192.2), and it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 36971 is a prime number.

To determine if 88535 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2
Since 88535 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can skip checking divisibility by 2.

Step 2: Check divisibility by 3
To check if a number is divisible by 3, we sum its digits. In this case, 8 + 8 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 29. Since 29 is not divisible by 3, 88535 is not divisible by 3.

Step 3: Check divisibility by 5
If a number ends in 0 or 5, it is divisible by 5. Since 88535 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Step 4: Check divisibility by 7
To check if a number is divisible by 7, we can use the following rule: double the last digit and subtract it from the remaining truncated number. If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7. In this case, doubling the last digit (5) gives us 10. Subtracting 10 from the truncated number (8853) gives us 8843. Since 8843 is not divisible by 7, 88535 is not divisible by 7.

Step 5: Check divisibility by 11
To check if a number is divisible by 11, we can use the same rule as in step 4. Doubling the last digit (5) gives us 10. Subtracting 10 from the truncated number (8853) gives us 8843. Since 8843 is not divisible by 11, 88535 is not divisible by 11.

Since 88535 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that it is a prime number.

First, let's find the factors of 94811.

1. Check if the number is divisible by 2 (even numbers). 94811 is not even, so it's not divisible by 2.

2. Check if the number is divisible by 3. To do this, add the digits of the number: 9 + 4 + 8 + 1 + 1 = 23. Since 23 is not divisible by 3, neither is 94811.

3. Check if the number is divisible by 5. If the last digit is 0 or 5, the number is divisible by 5. The last digit of 94811 is 1, so it's not divisible by 5.

4. Check if the number is divisible by 7. There is no simple rule for divisibility by 7, so we can try dividing 94811 by 7: 94811 ÷ 7 = 13544.42857. Since the result is not a whole number, 94811 is not divisible by 7.

5. Continue checking divisibility by prime numbers (11, 13, 17, 19, 23, etc.) until you reach the square root of the number. The square root of 94811 is approximately 307.75.

To determine if 67561 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 67561 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 67561 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (6 + 7 + 5 + 6 + 1) is 25, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 67561 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 67561 is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 67561 is divisible by 7. We can use a divisibility rule for 7, which states that if we double the last digit (1) and subtract it from the remaining digits (6756 - 2), the result (6754) should be divisible by 7. However, 6754 is not divisible by 7, so 67561 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue by checking if 67561 is divisible by 11. We can use a divisibility rule for 11, which states that if we alternate adding and subtracting the digits, the result should be divisible by 11. In this case, (6 - 7 + 5 - 6 + 1) equals -1, which is not divisible by 11. Therefore, 67561 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 67561 is divisible by 13. We can use a divisibility rule for 13, which states that if we multiply the last digit (1) by 4 and subtract it from the remaining digits (6756 - 4), the result (6752) should be divisible by 13. However, 6752 is not divisible by 13, so 67561 is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 67561 and found that it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 67561 is a prime number.

To determine if 30462 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is even. 30462 is even because it ends in a 2, which means it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can add up the digits of 30462 to see if it is divisible by 3. 3 + 0 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 15, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 30462 is also divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. 30462 does not end in a 5 or 0, so it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using a trick. We take the last digit (2) and double it, then subtract it from the remaining digits (3046 - 4 = 3042). If this result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7. We can repeat this process until we get a number that is either divisible by 7 or less than 10. 304 - 2(2) = 300, which is divisible by 7. Therefore, 30462 is also divisible by 7.

To determine if 48643 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we check if it is divisible by 2. Since 48643 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check if it is divisible by 3. By adding up the digits of 48643 (4 + 8 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 25), we see that it is not divisible by 3.

Then, we check if it is divisible by 5. Since 48643 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

We continue checking divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 48643, which is approximately 220.6. 

After checking all the numbers up to 220, we find that 48643 is not divisible by any of them.

Therefore, 48643 is a prime number.

To determine if 68071 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 68071 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 68071 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up its digits: 6 + 8 + 0 + 7 + 1 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, 68071 is also not divisible by 3.

3. We continue this process by checking if 68071 is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 68071 is divisible by 7. We can use a divisibility rule for 7, which involves doubling the last digit (1) and subtracting it from the remaining truncated number (6807 - 2*1 = 6805). Since 6805 is not divisible by 7, 68071 is not divisible by 7.

5. We can also check if 68071 is divisible by 11. By alternatingly subtracting and adding the digits, we get: 6 - 8 + 0 - 7 + 1 = -8. Since -8 is not divisible by 11, 68071 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 68071 is divisible by 13. By subtracting 4 times the last digit (1) from the remaining truncated number (6807 - 4*1 = 6803), we get 6803. Since 6803 is not divisible by 13, 68071 is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 68071 and found that it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 68071 is a prime number.

[Yes]

Step by step explanation: 

1. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. 

2. To determine if 25110 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. 

3. We can start by checking if 2 is a divisor of 25110. To do this, we can check if 25110 is even (i.e. if its last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). However, 25110 is not even, so 2 is not a divisor. 

4. We can then check if 3 is a divisor of 25110 by adding up its digits and checking if the sum is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 25110 is 2+5+1+1+0=9, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 3 is a divisor of 25110. 

5. Since 25110 has a positive integer divisor other than 1 and itself (namely, 3), it is not a prime number.

--------------------------------------------------

To determine if 99737 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 99737 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 99737 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up its digits: 9 + 9 + 7 + 3 + 7 = 35. Since 35 is not divisible by 3, 99737 is also not divisible by 3.

3. We continue this process by checking if 99737 is divisible by 5. The last digit is 7, which is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 99737 is divisible by 7. To do this, we can use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that if the difference between twice the last digit and the remaining digits is divisible by 7, then the number is divisible by 7. In this case, twice the last digit is 7 * 2 = 14. Subtracting 14 from the remaining digits (9973) gives us 9959. Since 9959 is not divisible by 7, 99737 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue this process by checking if 99737 is divisible by 11. To do this, we can use the alternating sum of digits rule for divisibility by 11. The alternating sum of digits is 9 - 9 + 7 - 3 + 7 = 11. Since 11 is divisible by 11, 99737 is divisible by 11.

Since 99737 is divisible by 11, it is not a prime number.

To determine if 55248 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit is even, we know it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits is 24, which is divisible by 3, so 55248 is also divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is 8, it is not divisible by 5. 

4. However, we can check if it is divisible by 7 using a divisibility rule. Subtract twice the last digit (2 x 8 = 16) from the remaining digits (5524 - 16 = 5508). If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7. We can repeat this process until we get a result that is either divisible or not divisible by 7. 

5508 - 2 x 8 = 5492 

549 - 2 x 2 = 545 

54 - 2 x 5 = 44 

44 is not divisible by 7, so 55248 is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can also check if it is divisible by 11 using a similar rule. Add and subtract alternating digits (5 + 2 - 5 + 4 - 8 = -2). If the result is divisible by 11, then the original number is also divisible by 11. 

-2 is not divisible by 11, so 55248 is not divisible by 11. 

Since we have found factors other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 55248 is not a prime number.

To determine if 54813 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. First, we check if 54813 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we move on to the next step.

2. Next, we check if 54813 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up the digits of 54813: 5 + 4 + 8 + 1 + 3 = 21. Since 21 is not divisible by 3, 54813 is also not divisible by 3.

3. Now, we check if 54813 is divisible by 5. If the last digit of a number is 0 or 5, then the number itself is divisible by 5. However, the last digit of 54813 is 3, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Moving on, we check if 54813 is divisible by 7. There is no simple rule for divisibility by 7, so we need to perform a division. After dividing 54813 by 7, we find that it is not a whole number, indicating that 54813 is not divisible by 7.

5. Finally, we check if 54813 is divisible by 11. Again, there is no simple rule for divisibility by 11, so we perform a division. After dividing 54813 by 11, we find that it is not a whole number, indicating that 54813 is not divisible by 11.

Since 54813 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that it is a prime number.

Step by step explanation: 

1. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. 

2. To determine if 91989 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. 

3. We can start by checking if 2 is a divisor of 91989. To do this, we can check if 91989 is even (i.e. if its last digit is even). However, the last digit of 91989 is 9, which is odd, so 2 is not a divisor of 91989. 

4. We can continue checking for divisors by trying the next odd integer, which is 3. To check if 3 is a divisor of 91989, we can add up its digits and see if the sum is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 91989 is 9+1+9+8+9=36, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 3 is a divisor of 91989. 

5. Since we have found a positive integer divisor of 91989 other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 91989 is not a prime number.

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits is 8+4+7+0+5=24, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 84705 is also divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7. This is a bit trickier, but we can use the following method: double the last digit (5) and subtract it from the remaining digits (8470 - 10 = 8460). If the result (8460) is divisible by 7, then so is the original number (84705). However, 8460 is not divisible by 7, so 84705 is not either. 

5. We can continue checking for divisibility by other prime numbers, but we can already see that 84705 is not only divisible by 1 and itself. Therefore, it is not a prime number.

Then, we can check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is not 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

We can also check if it is divisible by 7. By applying the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number (6783 - 2*5 = 6773). Since 6773 is not divisible by 7, 67835 is not divisible by 7.

Continuing this process, we can check if it is divisible by 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, or 97. However, this would be a time-consuming process.

To determine if 78402 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. We can start by checking if it is even. 78402 is even because it ends in a 2, which means it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can add up the digits of 78402 to see if it is divisible by 3. 7+8+4+0+2 = 21, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 78402 is also divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. 78402 does not end in a 5 or 0, so it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7 using a trick. We take the last digit (2) and double it, then subtract it from the remaining digits (7840 - 4 = 7836). If this result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7. We can repeat this process until we get a number that is either divisible by 7 or less than 10. 7836 - 2(6) = 7824, which is not divisible by 7. We can continue: 782 - 2(4) = 774, which is divisible by 7. Therefore, 78402 is also divisible by 7. 

Since 78402 is divisible by 2, 3, and 7, it is not a prime number.

To determine if 55491 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 55491 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we move on to the next step.

2. Next, we check if 55491 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (5 + 5 + 4 + 9 + 1 = 24) is not divisible by 3, so 55491 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 55491 is divisible by 5. The last digit is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 55491 is divisible by 7. By applying the divisibility rule for 7 (subtracting twice the last digit from the remaining truncated number), we get 5549 - 2*1 = 5547. Since 5547 is not divisible by 7, neither is 55491.

5. We continue by checking if 55491 is divisible by 11. By applying the divisibility rule for 11 (subtracting the alternating sum of digits), we get 5 - 5 + 4 - 9 + 1 = -4. Since -4 is not divisible by 11, neither is 55491.

6. Finally, we check if 55491 is divisible by 13. By applying the divisibility rule for 13 (subtracting four times the last digit from the remaining truncated number), we get 5549 - 4*1 = 5545. Since 5545 is not divisible by 13, neither is 55491.

Since 55491 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that it is a prime number.

Step 1: Find the square root of 53954. The square root of 53954 is approximately 232.3.

Step 2: Check divisibility by numbers up to the square root (232).

53954 is divisible by 2 because it ends in an even number (4). Dividing 53954 by 2 gives us 26977.

53954 is not divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits (5 + 3 + 9 + 5 + 4 = 26) is not divisible by 3.

53954 is not divisible by 5 because it does not end in 0 or 5.

53954 is not divisible by 7 because the difference between twice the last digit (2 * 4 = 8) and the remaining leading digits (5395) is not divisible by 7.

Step 3: Check divisibility by numbers greater than the square root (232).

We do not need to check divisibility by numbers greater than the square root because if 53954 is divisible by any number greater than its square root, it must also be divisible by a number smaller than the square root.

Since 53954 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that it is a prime number.

Step by step explanation: 

1. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. 

2. To determine if 99158 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. 

3. We can start by checking if 2 is a divisor of 99158. To do this, we can check if 99158 is even (i.e. if its last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). However, the last digit of 99158 is 8, which is not even, so 2 is not a divisor of 99158. 

4. We can continue checking for divisors by dividing 99158 by odd integers greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of 99158 (which is approximately 315.1). 

5. However, we can also notice that 99158 is divisible by 2 and 7, since the sum of its digits is 32 (which is divisible by 4 and 9, and therefore by 2 and 7). Therefore, 99158 is not a prime number.

1. We start by checking if 22547 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 22547 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (2 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 7 = 20) is not divisible by 3, so 22547 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 22547 is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 22547 is divisible by 7. We can use a divisibility rule for 7: subtract twice the last digit (7) from the remaining digits (2254 - 2*7 = 2240). Since 2240 is divisible by 7, 22547 is also divisible by 7.

Therefore, 22547 is not a prime number.

To determine if 96739 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. We can start by checking if it is even. If it is, then it is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2. However, 96739 is odd, so we can continue. 

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 96739. The square root of 96739 is approximately 311. So, we only need to check if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 311. 

3. We can use a prime factorization calculator or a list of prime numbers to check if any of them divide evenly into 96739. After checking, we find that 96739 is divisible by 7 and 13819.

To determine if 42583 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since 42583 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can move on to the next prime number, which is 3.

To check if 42583 is divisible by 3, we add up its digits: 4 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 3 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 42583 is not divisible by 3.

Next, we can check if it is divisible by 5. Since 42583 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Now, we can check if it is divisible by 7. We can use a divisibility rule for 7, which involves doubling the last digit (3) and subtracting it from the remaining truncated number (4258). 2 * 3 = 6, and 4258 - 6 = 4252. We repeat this process until we can determine if 42583 is divisible by 7. 

6 * 2 = 12, and 425 - 12 = 413. 
3 * 2 = 6, and 41 - 6 = 35. 

Since 35 is divisible by 7, we can conclude that 42583 is also divisible by 7.

Therefore, 42583 is not a prime number.

Step 2: Find the square root of the number. The square root of 34193 is approximately 184.64.

Step 3: Check if the number is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root. The prime numbers less than or equal to 184.64 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, and 181.

Step 4: Divide 34193 by each of these prime numbers. If any of them divide 34193 without a remainder, then 34193 is not prime. If none of them divide 34193 without a remainder, then 34193 is prime.

After checking, none of these prime numbers divide 34193 without a remainder.

To determine if 77960 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit is even, we know that it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits (7+7+9+6+0) is 29, which is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is 0, we know that it is divisible by 5. 

4. We can check if it is divisible by 7. This is a bit more difficult, but we can use a trick where we take the last digit (0) and double it, then subtract it from the remaining digits (7796 - 0*2 = 7796). If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7. We can repeat this process until we get a number that is either divisible by 7 or less than 10. 

7796 - 0*2 = 7796

779 - 6*2 = 767

76 - 14 = 62

6 - 4*2 = -2

Since -2 is less than 10 and not divisible by 7, we can conclude that 77960 is not divisible by 7. 

5. We can continue this process for other prime numbers, but we can also use a calculator or a computer program to check if it is divisible by any other prime numbers. In this case, we find that 77960 is divisible by 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 38, 40, 76, 95, 152, 190, 380, 7796, and 15592. Therefore, it is not a prime number.

To determine if 15727 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 2 is a divisor of 15727. Since 2 is an even number and 15727 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 3 is a divisor of 15727. To do this, we add the digits of 15727: 1 + 5 + 7 + 2 + 7 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, 15727 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue this process with higher prime numbers. Checking if 5 is a divisor, we find that the last digit of 15727 is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Moving on to 7, we can add the digits of 15727 in groups of three: 15 + 727 = 742. Since 742 is not divisible by 7, 15727 is not divisible by 7.

5. We can continue this process with other prime numbers, but it is not necessary. By this point, we have checked all prime numbers up to the square root of 15727 (approximately 125.4), and none of them are divisors. Therefore, we can conclude that 15727 is a prime number.

Step 4: If the number is not divisible by any of these prime numbers, then it is prime. However, 82325 is divisible by 5 (82325 / 5 = 16465). 

So, the answer is [No]. 82325 is not a prime number.

To determine if 98966 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2
98966 is not divisible by 2 because it does not end in an even number.

Step 2: Check divisibility by 3
The sum of the digits of 98966 is 9 + 8 + 9 + 6 + 6 = 38, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 98966 is not divisible by 3.

Step 3: Check divisibility by 5
98966 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Step 4: Check divisibility by 7
To check if 98966 is divisible by 7, we can use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that if the difference between twice the units digit and the remaining digits is divisible by 7, then the number itself is divisible by 7.

Twice the units digit of 98966 is 2 * 6 = 12.
The remaining digits are 9896.
The difference between 12 and 9896 is 9884, which is not divisible by 7.
Therefore, 98966 is not divisible by 7.

Step 5: Check divisibility by 11
To check if 98966 is divisible by 11, we can use the divisibility rule for 11, which states that if the difference between the sum of the odd-positioned digits and the sum of the even-positioned digits is divisible by 11, then the number itself is divisible by 11.

The odd-positioned digits of 98966 are 9, 9, and 6, which sum to 24.
The even-positioned digits of 98966 are 8 and 6, which sum to 14.
The difference between 24 and 14 is 10, which is not divisible by 11.
Therefore, 98966 is not divisible by 11.

Since 98966 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that it is a prime number.

To determine if 88212 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit is even, we know it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits is 21, which is divisible by 3, so 88212 is also divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is 2, it is not divisible by 5. 

4. However, we can check if it is divisible by 7 using the following method: 

- Take the last digit (2) and double it: 2 x 2 = 4 
- Subtract this from the remaining digits: 8821 - 4 = 8817 
- Repeat this process until you get a number you recognize or can easily check: 
    - Double the last digit (7) and subtract from the remaining digits: 881 - 14 = 867 
    - Double the last digit (4) and subtract from the remaining digits: 86 - 8 = 78 
    - Double the last digit (8) and subtract from the remaining digits: 7 - 16 = -9 

Since -9 is not a recognizable number, we cannot determine if 88212 is divisible by 7 using this method. 

5. We can also check if it is divisible by 11 using the following method: 

- Add up every other digit starting from the right: 2 + 1 + 8 = 11 
- Add up the remaining digits: 8 + 2 + 2 = 12 
- Subtract the second sum from the first: 11 - 12 = -1 

Since -1 is not divisible by 11, we cannot determine if 88212 is divisible by 11 using this method. 

Therefore, we have found that 88212 is divisible by 2, 3, and possibly 7 and 11. Since it is not only divisible by 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

We can continue this process for other prime numbers, but for the sake of brevity, let's skip to the square root of 94017, which is approximately 306.6.

We check if 94017 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 306.6. After checking, we find that it is not divisible by any of these prime numbers.

Therefore, 94017 is a prime number.

We can also check if it is divisible by 5. 62108 does not end in a 5 or 0, so it is not divisible by 5. 

However, we can find that 62108 is divisible by 4, because the last two digits (08) form a number that is divisible by 4. 

Therefore, 62108 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2 and 4.

To determine if 68066 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. We can start by checking if it is even. 68066 is even because it ends in a 6, which means it is divisible by 2. 

2. We can then check if it is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up the digits of 68066: 6 + 8 + 0 + 6 + 6 = 26. Since 26 is not divisible by 3, we know that 68066 is not divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. 68066 does not end in a 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5. 

4. We can continue checking for divisibility by other prime numbers, but we can also use a calculator or a computer program to check if it has any other factors. 

After checking for divisibility by several small prime numbers, we can conclude that 68066 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2 and 17 (68066 ÷ 2 = 34033 and 68066 ÷ 17 = 4004).

2. Next, we check if 86165 is divisible by 3. By adding the digits of 86165 (8 + 6 + 1 + 6 + 5 = 26), we see that the sum is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 86165 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue this process by checking if 86165 is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is not 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 86165 is divisible by 7. By using a calculator or long division, we find that 86165 ÷ 7 = 12309.2857. Since the result is not a whole number, 86165 is not divisible by 7.

5. We can continue this process by checking if 86165 is divisible by 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and so on. However, for the sake of brevity, let's stop here.

Since we have checked several prime numbers and found that 86165 is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 86165 is a prime number.

To determine if 76961 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 

First, we check if it is divisible by 2. Since 76961 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we check if it is divisible by 3. By adding up the digits of 76961 (7 + 6 + 9 + 6 + 1 = 29), we see that it is not divisible by 3.

Then, we check if it is divisible by 5. Since 76961 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Next, we check if it is divisible by 7. By applying the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number (7696 - 2*1 = 7694). Since 7694 is not divisible by 7, 76961 is also not divisible by 7.

Continuing this process, we check if it is divisible by 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97. However, none of these numbers divide 76961 evenly.

To determine if 75720 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit is even, we know it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits is 21, which is divisible by 3, so 75720 is also divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is 0, we know it is divisible by 5. 

4. Finally, we can check if it is divisible by 7. This requires a bit more work, but we can use the following trick: double the last digit (0) and subtract it from the remaining digits (7572 - 0*2 = 7572). If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is also divisible by 7. We can repeat this process until we get a number that is clearly divisible by 7: 

7572 - 0*2 = 7572

757 - 2*2 = 753

75 - 3*2 = 69

6 - 9*2 = -12

-1 - 2*2 = -5

Since -5 is not divisible by 7, we know that 75720 is not divisible by 7. 

Therefore, 75720 is not a prime number.

To determine if 87366 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

1. First, we can check if it is divisible by 2. Since the last digit is even, we know it is divisible by 2. 

2. Next, we can check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits is 30, which is divisible by 3, so 87366 is also divisible by 3. 

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5. The last digit is 6, which is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5. 

4. However, we can check if it is divisible by 7 using the following method: 

- Take the last digit (6) and double it: 6 x 2 = 12 
- Subtract this from the remaining digits: 8736 - 12 = 8724 
- Repeat this process until you get a number you recognize or can easily check: 
    - Double the last digit (4): 4 x 2 = 8 
    - Subtract from remaining digits: 872 - 8 = 864 
    - Double the last digit (4): 4 x 2 = 8 
    - Subtract from remaining digits: 86 - 8 = 78 
    - Double the last digit (8): 8 x 2 = 16 
    - Subtract from remaining digits: 7 - 16 = -9 

Since -9 is not a recognizable number, we cannot determine if 87366 is divisible by 7 using this method. 

5. We can also check if it is divisible by 11 using the following method: 

- Add up every other digit starting from the right: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 
- Add up the remaining digits: 7 + 7 + 8 = 22 
- Subtract the smaller sum from the larger sum: 22 - 17 = 5 

Since 5 is not 0 or a multiple of 11, we know that 87366 is not divisible by 11. 

Therefore, we have found that 87366 is divisible by 2, 3, and 7, which means it is not a prime number.
